# AI Generated Telco Newsletter
Goal is to help keep up with trends in the Data and AI space for US Telecoms. Specifically how:
- Platforms and vendors that telcos are using
- New trends in the space
- Uncover areas where a company like Databricks can help drive more value

Initial attempt is a short-and-sweet analysis of news from the prior week. Future versions will 
- Collect news more programmatically
- Save results and do NER to tag
- Analyze longer periods of more diverse articles
- Allow for monthly or quarterly summaries of the summaries
