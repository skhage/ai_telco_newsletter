## Company-Specific Updates

### **AT&T**
1. **Fiber Deployment for AI Data Centers**:
   - AT&T partnered with Jericho Energy Ventures to provide at least 10Gbps fiber connectivity for its Modular High Performance AI Data Center in Oklahoma. This infrastructure is scalable beyond 100Gbps to meet future demand growth[2](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250410/ai-ml/ai-infra-brief-from-nvidia)[4](https://potsandpansbyccg.com/category/the-industry/).
   
2. **Potential Acquisition of Lumen's Consumer Fiber Business**:
   - Reports suggest that AT&T may bid $5.5 billion for Lumen's retail fiber operations. If successful, this acquisition could significantly expand AT&T’s footprint while impacting competitors like T-Mobile[1](https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/next-big-telecom-ma-deal-horizon)[9](https://www.lightreading.com/satellite/at-t-teases-limited-voice-connectivity-from-satellites-in-late-2026).

3. **FirstNet Expansion**:
   - FirstNet®, built by AT&T for first responders, now covers over 2.99 million square miles with enhanced solutions such as MegaRange™ routers for better building penetration[6](https://about.att.com/story/2025/google-pixel-9a.html).

4. **New Device Launches**:

### **T-Mobile**
1. While no specific announcements were made this week about new initiatives or products from T-Mobile directly related to data technology or infrastructure expansion during this period, the company remains a key player in ongoing industry discussions about potential M&A activity involving Charter Communications or other strategic moves[1](https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/next-big-telecom-ma-deal-horizon).

### **Verizon**

### **Lumen Technologies**
1. **Consumer Fiber Business Sale Speculation**:
   - Analysts predict that selling its Mass Market consumer fiber division is likely as Lumen shifts focus toward enterprise services powered by AI technologies[1](https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/next-big-telecom-ma-deal-horizon). This move aligns with broader trends of divestment among telecom providers.

2. Participation in Industry Events:
