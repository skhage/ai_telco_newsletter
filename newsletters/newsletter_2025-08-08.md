- **Convergence of Mobile and Home Broadband:** The push for bundled services—combining mobile and home broadband—is intensifying, with cable operators currently holding a competitive edge due to their established infrastructure.
- **Network Security and Robocall Mitigation:** Tier-1 carriers have made significant progress in implementing STIR/SHAKEN^[Secure Telephone Identity Revisited/Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs] protocols to combat robocalls, but vulnerabilities remain among smaller, non-IP^[Internet Protocol] carriers.
- **Fiber Shortages and Growth Challenges:** T-Mobile and others face fiber shortages, impacting their ability to compete in the converged services market.
- **Subscriber Churn and Market Uncertainty:** Broadband subscriber growth is slowing, with some operators experiencing net losses due to increased competition and macroeconomic pressures.

### AT&T

- **Pending Acquisition:** AT&T is awaiting regulatory approval for its planned $5.75 billion acquisition of Lumen’s fiber access assets. This move is part of a broader industry trend toward acquiring fiber infrastructure to support converged broadband and mobile offerings[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-gets-its-m-a-wishes-after-ditching-dei-53423/)[2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/another-wave-of-fiber-and-cable-m-a-could-be-heading-our-way).
- **Convergence Strategy:** AT&T is actively seeking additional fiber assets to bolster its position in the home broadband/mobile convergence race, aiming to close the gap with cable operators who already offer robust bundled services[2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/another-wave-of-fiber-and-cable-m-a-could-be-heading-our-way).
- **Robocall Protection:** AT&T, as a tier-1 carrier, maintains a high rate of STIR/SHAKEN-signed call traffic, helping protect subscribers from robocalls[4](https://tnsi.com/resource/com/tns-half-year-2025-robocall-report-bad-actors-exploiting-non-ip-networks-of-smaller-carriers-press-release/).

### T-Mobile

- **M&A Developments:** T-Mobile received Department of Justice clearance for its $4.4 billion acquisition of most of UScellular’s assets, further consolidating its market position[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-gets-its-m-a-wishes-after-ditching-dei-53423/).
- **Growth Headwinds:** T-Mobile is facing a fiber shortage, which is hampering its ability to compete in the converged broadband/mobile market. Analysts have downgraded the company’s outlook, citing its "poor competitive position" relative to rivals with more robust fiber holdings[3](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/downgrades/25/07/46323942/t-mobiles-growth-stunted-by-fiber-shortage-and-market-rivalry).
- **Bundled Services Pressure:** The lack of a comprehensive bundled offer is seen as a strategic weakness, especially as cable operators gain share in the converged services segment[3](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/downgrades/25/07/46323942/t-mobiles-growth-stunted-by-fiber-shortage-and-market-rivalry).
- **Robocall Mitigation:** T-Mobile continues to deliver high levels of signed call traffic, maintaining strong protection against robocalls[4](https://tnsi.com/resource/com/tns-half-year-2025-robocall-report-bad-actors-exploiting-non-ip-networks-of-smaller-carriers-press-release/).

### Verizon

- **Major Acquisition:** Verizon has received regulatory approval to acquire Frontier Communications’ broadband assets for $20 billion, a move that strengthens its fiber footprint and supports its convergence strategy[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-gets-its-m-a-wishes-after-ditching-dei-53423/).
- **Convergence Focus:** Verizon is expected to continue pursuing additional fiber assets to enhance its bundled service offerings, aiming to better compete with cable operators[2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/another-wave-of-fiber-and-cable-m-a-could-be-heading-our-way).
- **Robocall Security:** Like its peers, Verizon maintains a high rate of STI
