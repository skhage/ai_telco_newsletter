### Key Industry Trends and News

#### AT&T

**Network Upgrades and Open RAN Efforts**
- **Progress in Network Upgrade Project**: AT&T officials have highlighted the progress in the company's $14 billion network upgrade project with Ericsson. The initial phase involves replacing Nokia radios with Ericsson radios at a third of AT&T's cell sites, with thousands of sites already upgraded [2].
- **Open RAN Strategy**: AT&T is moving forward with its open RAN strategy, deploying Ericsson's massive MIMO radios and planning to install small cell radios from Mavenir and Fujitsu later this year. The company is also exploring open RAN technology through the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) to develop standards for multivendor service management orchestration (SMO) implementations [2].
- **Cloud RAN Plans**: AT&T plans to launch cloud RAN functions later this year, leveraging Ericsson's software, Dell's servers, and Intel's processors. However, obtaining the latest Intel chips is a sticking point, as they will allow for a single-box deployment rather than multiple computing elements [2].
- **AI Integration**: AT&T is keen on injecting AI smarts into its network and operations but does not see a need to deploy Nvidia GPUs at cell sites for AI inferencing services. The company is watching the AI RAN Alliance but does not intend to join [2].

**Fiber Expansion and Financial Guidance**
- **Fiber Deployment Goals**: AT&T has boosted its goal of deploying fiber, aiming to pass 50 million locations by the end of 2029. The company expects to close this year with 29 million fiber locations passed and plans to pass more than 3 million additional locations annually over the next five years [3].
- **Financial Strategy**: AT&T is on track to meet its 2025 consolidated financial guidance and deliver on its multi-year outlook. The company expects to return $40 billion+ of financial capacity to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, with a focus on organic growth and maintaining its current annualized common stock dividend of $1.11 per share [4].

**Strategic Growth Plan**
- **Customer-Centric Approach**: AT&T is embarking on a multi-year strategic growth plan centered around putting customers first and continued network investment. The company aims to become the best connectivity provider in America and remains focused on growing durable converged relationships with high-quality 5G & fiber customers [4].

#### T-Mobile

**Satellite Connectivity and Spectrum Management**
- **T-Mobile Starlink Beta Test**: T-Mobile and SpaceX have opened up registration for T-Mobile Starlink, a joint program that allows T-Mobile users to connect to SpaceX’s Starlink satellites for connectivity in areas without terrestrial wireless coverage. The beta program is free for all postpaid voice customers with a compatible device, with texting support starting in early 2025 and voice and data support coming in the future [3].

**Wireless Capex and Spectrum Sales**
- **Wireless Capex Spend**: T-Mobile is expected to spend around $9 billion on wireless capex in 2025, with peak spending expected in 2025 before normalizing in 2026 and 2027 as open RAN efforts conclude. The company still has coverage requirements to reach for 2.5GHz and selected C-Band upgrades [3].

**Spectrum Sales**
- **Spectrum Divestment**: T-Mobile has fully divested its 3.45 GHz upper mid-band spectrum holdings via two transactions, including a swap with SoniqWave for an estimated value of ~$159 million and a sale to Columbia Capital for more than $2.7 billion [3].

#### Verizon

**Consumer and Business Growth**
- **Consumer Growth**: Verizon has maintained retail + wholesale consumer growth, but prepaid stabilization has not been proven yet. The company's consumer postpaid phone base is within one half of 1% of their 3Q 2021 high, with business postpaid phone subscribers growing at very strong rates (3.5% annually) [1].
  
**Prepaid Subscribers**
- **Prepaid Challenges**: Verizon's consumer prepaid subscriber base is clinging to a 20 million base, more than 3.7 million lower than the day they closed the Tracfone transaction. Investors expect more growth from the company's investments into Visible and Total Wireless brands to justify the original Tracfone purchase price [1].

#### Lumen Technologies

**Consumer Fiber Unit Sale**
- **Sale of Consumer Fiber Unit**: Lumen Technologies has begun the process of selling its consumer fiber business, signaling a shift in its operational focus while addressing substantial debt. The potential transaction is valued between $6 billion and $9 billion, underscoring Lumen’s intent to move away from legacy markets and align itself with burgeoning opportunities in artificial intelligence [3].
