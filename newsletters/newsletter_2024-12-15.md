### Week in Review: Data Technology Trends in the United States

#### **ACP Program Expiration Impact**
- **Wireline vs. Wireless and Satellite:** The expiration of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) on May 31, 2024, has had a significant impact on broadband subscribers. While wireline providers generally retained a strong customer base, wireless and satellite providers faced substantial losses. Approximately 70-80% of wireless ACP-supported customers (around 9-10 million subscribers) no longer maintained service, and satellite providers lost over 90% of their ACP-supported customers [1].
- **Company-Specific Data:** Among wireline providers, Charter Communications suffered the largest losses, projecting a total decline of 355,000 ACP-supported subscribers. Comcast followed with an expected loss of 96,000 ACP subscribers by year-end. AT&T projected a total loss of 85,000 ACP subscribers, while Cox Communications expected to lose 52,000 ACP participants [1].

#### **Convergence in Broadband and Wireless Services**
- **T-Mobile's Stance on Convergence:** T-Mobile has been vocal about the convergence of wireless and wireline services. Despite AT&T and Verizon's efforts to bundle more fiber-based internet services with mobile plans, T-Mobile downplays the importance of a fiber footprint. T-Mobile's market cap recently set a record at over $284 billion, far exceeding AT&T and Verizon's valuations [2].
- **Benefits of Convergence:** Analysts note that while convergence offers benefits like reduced postpaid phone churn (up to 50% for Verizon), T-Mobile remains bearish on its impact on gross adds. T-Mobile believes that bundling discounts only drive 5% of switching and does not lose wireless share in AT&T's fiber markets [2].

#### **Fierce Network Updates**
- **T-Mobile's Spectrum Use:** T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert discussed the use and availability of midband spectrum (2.5 GHz and C-Band) at a UBS event, highlighting that much of their spectrum remains unused in the fight for 5G dominance [3].
- **FWA Price Cuts:** T-Mobile rolled out new Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) plans priced as low as $35/month, with a new tier called “Amplified Internet” for $60. These plans are $15 cheaper for customers who have mobile service with T-Mobile, aiming to shift the mix to bundled customers [2].

#### **Security Concerns and Legislation**
- **Metadata Breach:** AT&T and Verizon have been criticized for not notifying customers whose metadata was stolen by Chinese hackers. The Salt Typhoon hacker group accessed metadata for over a million people, primarily in the Washington, D.C., area. The FBI is not putting pressure on these companies to notify affected customers [4].
- **Legislative Action:** In response to the breach, legislative action is expected. A Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing on December 11 will examine the risks to communication networks and evaluate measures to prevent future breaches. Industry representatives will testify on preventive measures [5].

#### **Industry Impact**
- **Network Security Prioritization:** Incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr has vowed to prioritize network security in the coming months, emphasizing collaboration with national security agencies to tackle the threat posed by Chinese cyber espionage [5].
- **Global Fallout:** The breach underscores broader risks to critical infrastructure globally, with dozens of companies affected and extensive metadata stolen. US officials have disclosed that this reflects an alarming escalation in China's cyber capabilities [5].
