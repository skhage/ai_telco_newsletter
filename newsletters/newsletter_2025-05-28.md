# US Telecom Weekly Roundup: Data Technology Trends

## Industry Trends

The US telecommunications market continues to show robust growth, with projections indicating an expansion of USD 123.8 billion between 2024-2029 at an impressive CAGR^[Compound Annual Growth Rate] of 6.8%[1]. This growth is primarily fueled by increasing broadband demand, strategic M&A^[Mergers and Acquisitions] activity, and surging mobile data traffic[1]. The broadband services market specifically is on a steep upward trajectory, having been valued at USD 445.3 billion in 2023 and projected to reach USD 1,016.9 billion by 2032[2].

Fiber deployment remains the dominant infrastructure strategy for major carriers, with companies aggressively expanding their FTTH^[Fiber to the Home] footprints through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. This week's developments highlight how telecom giants are positioning themselves for long-term infrastructure plays in the increasingly competitive high-speed internet market.

## Company News

### AT&T

AT&T made the biggest splash this week with its announcement of a $5.75 billion all-cash acquisition of Lumen Technologies' Mass Markets fiber business[3][5]. This strategic move will:

- Expand AT&T's fiber footprint across 11 additional states, bringing in approximately 1 million subscribers and over 4 million enabled locations[5]
- Increase AT&T's fiber target to 60 million locations by 2030, effectively doubling its current network reach[4]
- Give AT&T access to key metro markets including Denver, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Portland, and Seattle[5]
- Incorporate Lumen's existing construction assets and fiber network components to accelerate AT&T Fiber expansion[5]

AT&T CEO John Stankey framed the acquisition as a long-term infrastructure investment aligned with the company's mission to deliver high-quality, fiber-based internet services, stating: "We're leading the race to connect more Americans with fiber, the best broadband technology available."[5]

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approvals[5].

### Lumen Technologies

For Lumen, the $5.75 billion sale of its consumer fiber business to AT&T represents a strategic pivot to focus on its enterprise services[3][5]. The company is:

- Doubling down on its position as a digital infrastructure partner for enterprises[5]
- Focusing on advanced, intelligent networks driven by AI^[Artificial Intelligence], edge computing, and multicloud ecosystems[5]
- Divesting most of its Quantum Fiber operations while maintaining certain strategic assets[5]

This repositioning allows Lumen to concentrate its resources on the enterprise market segment where it sees greater growth potential and competitive advantage.

### Verizon

While Verizon didn't make major announcements this week, the company remains a key player in the US telecom market[1]. As one of the leading vendors alongside AT&T and T-Mobile, Verizon continues to compete in the broadband and mobile data spaces that are driving industry growth.

### T-Mobile

T-Mobile continues to be recognized as one of the leading telecom providers in the US market[1]. The company is positioned to benefit from the projected market growth, particularly in mobile data services, though no specific announcements were made this week.

### Charter Communications

Charter Communications was identified as one of the key vendors in the US telecom market analysis[1], though the company made no major data technology announcements this week.

## Market Outlook

The telecommunications landscape is undergoing significant transformation as companies reposition themselves through strategic acquisitions and focused investments. AT&T's acquisition of Lumen's fiber assets represents the type of consolidation we can expect to see as carriers race to expand their high-speed broadband footprints.

With the broadband services market expected to more than double by 2032[2], we anticipate continued aggressive investment in fiber infrastructure and potential further M&A activity as companies compete for market share in this rapidly growing sector.
