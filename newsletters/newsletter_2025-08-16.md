*Tooltip: MVNO^[Mobile Virtual Network Operator]*

    - Secured an exclusive MVNO partnership with Comcast Business Mobile and Spectrum Mobile for Business (Charter), enabling both cable giants to offer enterprise mobile services over T-Mobile’s advanced 5G network—a significant win for its wholesale unit.
    - This deal positions T-Mobile as the backbone provider for business mobile connectivity among U.S. cable operators, intensifying competition in the B2B segment previously dominated by Verizon[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/digital-platforms-services/what-s-up-with-nokia-at-t-comcast-charter-t-mobile-us-53498/) .
    - Continues active pursuit of fiber assets alongside rivals; however, lacks nationwide bundle coverage compared to cable incumbents like Comcast or Charter[2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/another-wave-of-fiber-and-cable-m-a-could-be-heading-our-way/) .

### Verizon

    - Delivered Q2 earnings above analyst expectations ($1.22/share), buoyed by wireless service growth despite sector headwinds from tariffs affecting other industries.
    - Faces intensified competition in enterprise mobility after losing exclusivity on new business-focused MVNO deals with Comcast & Charter; retains existing consumer partnerships but risks erosion in future market share among business customers due to these shifts.
    - Remains active in seeking additional fiber assets but trails behind cable providers’ ability to offer converged broadband/mobile bundles across their entire footprint—a key factor driving current M&A activity within the sector [2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/another-wave-of-fiber-and-cable-m-a-could-be-heading-our-way/) .
