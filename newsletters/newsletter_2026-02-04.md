### Key Data Technology Trends in US Telecom (Week of Jan 28 - Feb 4, 2026)

The past week highlighted accelerating **fiber convergence** strategies among major carriers, with AT&T finalizing its Lumen acquisition to bolster fiber-wireless bundling, Verizon advancing Frontier integration for similar gains, and cable operators like Charter facing broadband erosion amid MVNO expansions[1][3][4][5]. **5G and fixed wireless access (FWA)** growth persisted, though saturation concerns emerged for T-Mobile, while Charter narrowed broadband losses through mobile line additions and network upgrades[2][4][6]. Overall, Q4 2025 earnings (reported Jan 28-30) underscored a shift toward integrated fiber-5G offerings, eroding cable monopolies and prioritizing subscriber loyalty via converged services, with AT&T targeting 40 million fiber locations by year-end[4].

### AT&T
AT&T dominated headlines with Q4 2025 earnings on January 28, reporting a "double beat" on resilience amid pricing wars, issuing a 2026 outlook of "profitable stability" driven by **fiber convergence**—bundling fiber broadband with 5G wireless to cut churn and boost ARPU[4](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2026-1-30-at-and-t-signals-resilience-in-2025-earnings-betting-on-fiber-convergence-to-stabilize-2026-outlook). The company added 288,000 fiber broadband subs and 270,000 to **Internet Air** (FWA), with 42% of fiber households now converged wireless users, and plans to hit 40 million fiber locations by end-2026 (50 million in-region by 2030, plus Lumen assets)[4][6](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2818011/t-vs-chtr-which-telecom-stock-has-more-upside-right-now).

A pivotal announcement was completing the $5.75 billion acquisition of Lumen's mass markets fiber business, adding 1 million fiber subscribers and 4 million locations—lowering integration risks versus Verizon's Frontier deal and unlocking ~3 million more subs via 20% convergence penetration[1][5](https://www.lightreading.com/fttx/at-t-completes-lumen-fiber-deal). AT&T ramped **FTTH^[Fiber to the Home]** buildout for 2026, deployed EchoStar mid-band spectrum across 23,000 sites (80% mobility speed boost, 55% for Internet Air in 5,300 cities/48 states), and launched industry-first guarantees for fiber (20-min downtime credits) and wireless (60-min)[3][6](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/at-t-ramping-up-fiber-buildout-pace-as-it-closes-in-on-lumen). Partnerships advanced with Mitsubishi for 5G in Outlander SUVs and AST SpaceMobile for satellite-direct-to-device to cover rural gaps[6].

### T-Mobile
T-Mobile featured in Charter's announcements, with a new business-focused **MVNO^[Mobile Virtual Network Operator]** agreement activating within six months to enable Charter's enterprise mobile services over T-Mobile's 5G network[2](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/charter-s-stock-pops-as-video-subs-grow-broadband-losses-narrow). Earnings context noted T-Mobile's growth slowing in a saturated market, relying on **FWA** amid capacity risks without native fiber scale[4]. No standalone T-Mobile announcements this week, but its nationwide 5G supports Charter's 11.4 million mobile lines (up 22% YoY as of Q3 2025)[2][6].

### Verizon
Verizon's Q4 earnings on January 30 showed a "turnaround quarter" with 616,000 postpaid phone net adds, fueled by **fiber convergence** post-Frontier acquisition (9+ million passings), positioning it to chase AT&T's lead despite integration complexities[1][4](https://sundaybrief.com/q4-earnings-review-part-1-money-cant-buy-you-love-but-it-can-buy-you-net-additions/). Rapid fiber expansion via Frontier accelerates deployment, challenging cable rivals like Charter[6].

### Lumen
Lumen's week centered on deal closure: AT&T acquired its mass markets fiber for $5.75B, transferring 1 million subs and 4 million locations to enhance AT&T's convergence (only 25% currently AT&T Mobility subs, with upside to 20%+ penetration)[1][5]. This leaves Lumen leaner, with AT&T eyeing easier integration than Verizon-Frontier[1].

### Charter Communications
Charter's stock rose on Q4 2025 results showing video sub growth and narrowin
