### Week in Review: Data Technology Trends in the United States

#### **AT&T**

- **Cybersecurity Breach**: AT&T, along with other major U.S. telcos like Lumen and Verizon, has confirmed that it was compromised by Chinese state-backed hackers. The breach, attributed to the threat group Salt Typhoon, highlights ongoing cybersecurity concerns in the industry. [3]
- **Super Bowl LIX Preparations**: AT&T has upgraded its network infrastructure around the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans to ensure seamless connectivity for attendees during Super Bowl LIX. The upgrades include an enhanced distributed antenna system (DAS) and the deployment of 5G Plus C-Band/3.45 and 4G LTE PCS/AWS/WCS spectrum. [4]

#### **T-Mobile**

- **2G Network Shutdown**: T-Mobile has set a final shutdown date for its aging 2G network, which will occur on February 9, 2025. The carrier is offering eligible users a free 5G replacement device as part of the transition. This move aligns with T-Mobile's strategy to focus on LTE and 5G services. [2]
- **Super Bowl LIX Preparations**: T-Mobile has made significant 5G upgrades around the Superdome, including the deployment of Ultra Capacity 5G and permanent upgrades to indoor distributed antenna systems (iDAS). The carrier aims to provide peak download speeds of up to 1.2Gbps inside the stadium. [4]
- **M&A Activity**: T-Mobile is actively involved in mergers and acquisitions, including a proposed acquisition of US Cellular's mobile operations and 30% of its spectrum license holdings for $4.4 billion. Additionally, T-Mobile has entered into joint ventures with private equity sponsors to acquire fiber optic network providers like Lumos and MetroNet. [1]

#### **Verizon**

- **Super Bowl LIX Preparations**: Verizon has also upgraded its network infrastructure around the Superdome, deploying 509 5G Ultra Wideband and 155 C-Band radios. The carrier has also utilized mmWave technology for fast connections and real-time network adjustments with vRAN for peak performance. [4]
- **FTTH Deployments**: Verizon is expected to increase its capital expenditures by around $1 billion in 2025, primarily to support fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) deployments. The company aims to add about 650,000 new FTTH passings in 2025, building on its 500,000 passings in 2024. [1]

#### **Lumen**

- **Cybersecurity Breach**: Lumen has confirmed that it was compromised by Chinese state-backed hackers, similar to AT&T and Verizon. The breach highlights ongoing cybersecurity risks in the industry. [3]
- **Enterprise AI Adoption**: Despite constraints from smaller operating budgets, Lumen is seeing early indications of a rebound in enterprise AI adoption. This could improve top-line trends from business customers, a segment that has been in secular decline for larger telcos. Lumen has secured about $8 billion in deals to provide custom fiber networks for hyperscalers and other technology companies. [1]

#### **Charter Communications**

- **Cybersecurity Breach**: Charter Communications was also reported to have been compromised by Chinese state-backed hackers, along with Windstream and Consolidated Communications. This breach underscores the vulnerability of U.S. telcos to cyber threats. [3]
