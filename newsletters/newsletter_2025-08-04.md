## AT&T

AT&T made headlines this week as part of a landmark M&A deal: the company announced an agreement to acquire Lumen Technologies' consumer fiber assets. This move aims to bolster AT&T's FTTH^[Fiber to the Home] footprint in key markets where it faces stiff competition from both cable (Charter) and other telcos (Verizon)[3](https://www.telecompetitor.com/telecom-ma-trends-report-bigger-deals-greater-focus-on-scale/). Analysts see this as part of AT&T’s broader push for scale—enabling more robust bundled offerings that combine wireless, home internet, and enterprise services[2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/another-wave-of-fiber-and-cable-m-a-could-be-heading-our-way).

No new product launches were reported this week; however, industry observers expect further announcements on network integration plans following regulatory review.

## T-Mobile

T-Mobile continued its aggressive expansion into fiber broadband. In mid-2025, it closed its acquisition of Lumos—a regional fiber ISP operating in the Carolinas/Virginia—and is awaiting approval for its purchase of Metronet in the Midwest[1](https://ts2.tech/en/top-10-us-internet-service-providers-of-2025-speed-coverage-and-customer-satisfaction-ranked/). These moves will give T-Mobile a projected footprint covering 12–15 million homes with direct fiber access over the next few years.

T-Mobile executives clarified that their strategy blends deep fiber deployments with FWA: “We can bring fiber close to the home and then use FWA for the last 100 feet where fiber is too costly,” one executive explained[1](https://ts2.tech/en/top-10-us-internet-service-providers-of-2025-speed-coverage-and-customer-satisfaction-ranked/). By owning regional backhaul infrastructure outright, T-Mobile reduces costs while boosting capacity for both mobile 5G^[Fifth Generation Mobile Networks] users and fixed customers.

## Verizon

Verizon’s focus remains on expanding its premium “5G Home” service—which debuted strongly this year with an ACSI score of 74 out of 100—just behind T-Mobile but well ahead of legacy cable or DSL options[1](https://ts2.tech/en/top-10-us-internet-service-providers-of-2025-speed-coverage-and-customer-satisfaction-ranked/). Verizon continues node upgrades in competitive markets where it faces pressure from Spectrum (Charter) or AT&T Fiber.

The company’s recent acquisition spree includes last year’s Frontier deal; these moves are designed to extend Verizon’s reach toward national coverage by integrating acquired networks into their own converged service bundles[3](https://www.telecompetitor.com/telecom-ma-trends-report-bigger-deals-greater-focus-on-scale/).

No major new product launches were reported this week; attention remains on network integration efforts post-acquisition.

## Lumen Technologies

Lumen was at center stage due to being acquired by AT&T as part of one of several mega-deals reshaping U.S. telecoms[3](https://www.telecompetitor.com/telecom-ma-trends-report-bigger-deals-greater-focus-on-scale/). Lumen had been facing increasing competition from both traditional telcos expanding FTTH footprints and aggressive overbuilders like Google Fiber. The sale marks another step toward market consolidation around scaled providers able to offer comprehensive bundles across geographies.

Industry analysts suggest that Lumen's assets will help accelerate AT&T's ambitions but also signal ongoing challenges for mid-tier providers unable to match investment levels required by next-generation infrastructure rollouts[3](https://www.telecompetitor.com/telecom-ma-trends-report-bigger-deals-greater-focus-on-scale/).

## Charter Communications (Spectrum)

Charter reported Q2 earnings showing modest revenue growth (+0.6% YoY), but persistent subscriber attrition led investors to punish shares—down over 30% YTD due largely to competitive pressures from FTTH upstarts like Lumen (now being absorbed by AT&T) as well as wireless alternatives such as T-Mobile FWA[4](https://www.ainvest.com/news
