**Key Industry Trends in U.S. Data Technology (Week of July 31, 2025)**

- **Enterprise Mobile Convergence:** The biggest development is a new exclusive MVNO^[Mobile Virtual Network Operator] partnership between T-Mobile US, Charter Communications, and Comcast, targeting the enterprise segment. This signals intensifying competition in business wireless and a shift in how cable and mobile operators approach converged services[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/digital-platforms-services/what-s-up-with-nokia-at-t-comcast-charter-t-mobile-us-53498/).
- **Fiber Asset M&A Activity:** AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile are expected to pursue further acquisitions of fiber assets to strengthen their broadband/mobile convergence strategies, while cable operators like Charter and Comcast already have robust offerings in this space[2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/another-wave-of-fiber-and-cable-m-a-could-be-heading-our-way).
- **Robocall Mitigation Progress:** 84% of call traffic among top U.S. telecom providers is now authenticated using STIR/SHAKEN protocols, reflecting industry-wide progress in combating robocalls and fraud, though non-IP networks of smaller carriers remain a vulnerability[3](https://www.gsma.com/get-involved/gsma-membership/gsma_resources/tns-half-year-2025-robocall-report-bad-actors-exploiting-non-ip-networks-of-smaller-carriers/).
- **Competitive Pressures and Customer Attrition:** Charter and other cable operators face persistent broadband subscriber losses and increased competition from fiber overbuilders (e.g., Lumen Technologies) and 5G providers (e.g., Verizon, T-Mobile)[4](https://www.ainvest.com/news/charter-communications-q2-2025-earnings-navigating-customer-attrition-innovation-partnerships-2507/).

### AT&T

- **Tax Savings Outlook:** AT&T expects to realize between $6.5 billion and $8 billion in cash tax savings from 2025 to 2027, which could enhance its ability to invest in network upgrades and fiber expansion[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/digital-platforms-services/what-s-up-with-nokia-at-t-comcast-charter-t-mobile-us-53498/).
- **Fiber Asset Acquisition:** Industry analysts expect AT&T to remain active in acquiring fiber assets to support its broadband/mobile convergence ambitions, though no specific deals were announced this week[2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/another-wave-of-fiber-and-cable-m-a-could-be-heading-our-way).
- **Robocall Authentication:** AT&T is among the major carriers signing 84% of inter-carrier call traffic, demonstrating leadership in STIR/SHAKEN adoption[3](https://www.gsma.com/get-involved/gsma-membership/gsma_resources/tns-half-year-2025-robocall-report-bad-actors-exploiting-non-ip-networks-of-smaller-carriers/).

### T-Mobile US

- **Enterprise MVNO Deal:** T-Mobile secured an exclusive MVNO partnership with Charter and Comcast to provide mobile services for enterprise customers under the Spectrum Mobile for Business and Comcast Business Mobile brands.

### Verizon

- **MVNO Competition:** Verizon faces a setback as Charter and Comcast shift their enterprise MVNO business to T-Mobile, though Verizon retains the consumer MVNO contracts for Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile. This increases competitive pressure in the enterprise wireless segment[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/digital-platforms-services/what-s-up-with-nokia-at-t-comcast-charter-t-mobile-us-53498/).
- **Fiber Asset Strategy:** Verizon is expected to continue seeking fiber acquisitions to support its broadband and mobile convergence, bu
