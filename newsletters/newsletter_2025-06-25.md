## Key Industry Trends in US Data Technology (Week of June 25, 2025)

- **Capital Expenditure^[Capex] Slowdown:** Major US telecoms—including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Lumen, and Charter—are tightening capex budgets amid economic headwinds. This is driven by weaker revenue growth forecasts, inflationary pressures from tariffs and labor costs (especially as data center investment surges), and a shift in focus toward operational efficiency rather than aggressive expansion[1](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/10/3096362/28124/en/US-Telecoms-Face-Capex-Decline-Amid-Economic-Challenges-A-Review-of-Key-Operators-Including-AT-T-Verizon-Charter-Comcast-T-Mobile-DT-Lumen-Frontier-and-More.html)[2](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250605145415/en/US-Telco-Capex-Fading-as-AI-Giants-Take-Center-Stage-New-Report-Focuses-on-Key-Operators-including-ATT-Verizon-Charter-Comcast-T-Mobile-DT-Lumen-Frontier-and-more---ResearchAndMarkets.com).
  
- **AI & Data Center Influence:** The rise of AI giants is reshaping the telecom landscape. Telcos are increasingly positioning themselves as backbone providers for the AI economy—focusing on automation, real-time network control, and supporting hyperscale data centers[1](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/10/3096362/28124/en/US-Telecoms-Face-Capex-Decline-Amid-Economic-Challenges-A-Review-of-Key-Operators-Including-AT-T-Verizon-Charter-Comcast-T-Mobile-DT-Lumen-Frontier-and-More.html)[2](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250605145415/en/US-Telco-Capex-Fading-as-AI-Giants-Take-Center-Stage-New-Report-Focuses-on-Key-Operators-including-ATT-Verizon-Charter-Comcast-T-Mobile-DT-Lumen--Frontier-and-more---ResearchAndMarkets.com).

## Company-Specific News

### AT&T

**Fiber Expansion Milestone**
  
AT&T announced its fiber broadband network now reaches 30 million consumer and business locations nationwide—ahead of schedule—as part of its long-term goal to reach 60 million by 2030. Since 2020, AT&T has invested $145 billion in wireline and wireless expansion and added over 5.7 million fiber customers[5](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/t--accelerates-fiber-network-expansion-will-it--boost--competitive-edge).

**Lumen Fiber Asset Acquisition**

A major development this week: AT&T agreed to acquire Lumen's Mass Markets consumer fiber business for $5.75 billion. This deal brings nearly one million subscribers and four million additional locations under AT&T’s umbrella—significantly boosting its FTTH^[Fiber to the Home] footprint[4](https://tecknexus.com//telecom-and-tech-merger-and-acquisition-tracker--2025). Integration plans are expected to be detailed during upcoming earnings calls[3](https://www.rcrwireless.com//20250623//analyst-angle//2q--earnings-preview).

### T-Mobile

**Integration with US Cellular**

Following recent spectrum acquisitions from US Cellular^[United States Cellular Corporation], T-Mobile is focused on improving coverage across these new markets using its existing mid-band spectrum (primarily at 2.5 GHz). Questions remain about how quickly it can integrate these assets into its national network footprint[3](https://www.rcrwireless.com//20250623//analyst-angle//2q--earnings-preview).

**Pricing Strategy Evolution**

With the pending Metronet acquisition closing soon, industry analysts are watching whether T-Mobile will adopt a "three tier + limited-time Founders Club" pricing model—a strategy that has seen mixed results elsewhere in the sector[3](https://www.rcrwireless.com//20250623//analyst-angle//2q--earnings-preview).

### Verizon

**C-Band Deployment & Fiber Churn**

Verizon continues expanding C-Band deployments (operating at 3.7–4.2 GHz) into secondary markets to match or exceed speed consistency versus competitors like T-Mobile[^EBS]. The company also reported very low churn rates (<1%) among non-mover fiber customers—a sign of strong retention but also raising questions about competitive dynamics with cable operators when customers do switch providers[3](https://www.rcrwireless.com//20250623//analyst-angle//
