## Company-Specific News

### AT&T

**Fiber & Fixed Wireless Expansion**
  
AT&T has expanded its Internet Air fixed wireless access service into 16 additional markets this month—a clear move to compete more directly with T-Mobile and Verizon in the FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access] space[5](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/). This follows strong Q4 fiber gains that have reinforced AT&T’s strategy to drive convergence between wired broadband and mobile offerings.

**Competitive Positioning**

AT&T remains focused on overbuilding its fiber network footprint—outpacing many cable rivals on cost structure and customer satisfaction metrics[3](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations/)—and leveraging bundled services across households for retention.

### T-Mobile

**M&A Strategy & Fiber Ambitions**

T-Mobile is nearing the close of its acquisition of US Cellular; an update on profit guidance is expected once the deal finalizes in May[3](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations/). CEO Mike Sievert has signaled a preference for acquiring pureplay fiber assets rather than cable or hybrid providers as part of T-Mobile’s long-term strategy[4](https://www.lightreading.com/fttx/t-mobile-ceo-prefers-pureplay-fiber-for-m-a).

There’s industry speculation about potential acquisitions (e.g., Hotwire Communications), but analysts suggest T-Mobile may target other compatible fiber players like Metronet or Lumos instead[3](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations/)—aiming to bundle wireless with home broadband for higher customer stickiness.

**Fixed Wireless Leadership**

T-Mobile continues leading the FWA segment through aggressive subscriber additions throughout last year; however, Verizon has started narrowing this gap recently[5](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/).

### Verizon

**Fiber Growth & FWA Competition**

Verizon ended Q4 with solid fiber subscriber growth as it seeks greater convergence between mobile and home internet products—a direct response to similar moves from AT&T[5](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/) . In fixed wireless access, Verizon narrowed net add differences versus T-Mobile during recent quarters.

However, Verizon reported a loss of nearly 289,000 postpaid phone customers in Q1—a signal that while network investments are ongoing, competitive pressures remain high from both AT&T and T-Mobile^[[4]](https://www.lightreading.com/fttx/t-mobile-ceo-prefers-pureplay-fiber-for-m-a).
