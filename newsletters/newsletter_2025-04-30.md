# Telecom Data Technology Weekly Roundup: April 24-30, 2025

## Industry Trends

The U.S. telecommunications landscape continues to evolve with significant movement in fiber acquisitions, wireless subscriber competition, and innovative connectivity solutions. Major carriers are pursuing aggressive fiber expansion strategies through M&A as they look to diversify beyond traditional wireless services. Meanwhile, the wireless market shows signs of contraction, with analysts predicting a shrinking customer pool for the major carriers[2]. Decentralized connectivity solutions are emerging as complementary technologies to traditional networks, evidenced by new partnerships in this space[1].

## Company News

### AT&T

- **Helium Network Partnership**: AT&T announced a strategic partnership with Helium Network to offer decentralized high-speed data to its mobile subscribers through user-enabled hotspots. This move aims to boost connectivity options for AT&T customers while leveraging Helium's innovative approach to network expansion[1].

- **Potential Lumen Acquisition**: Industry analysts are closely watching rumors about AT&T potentially acquiring Lumen Technologies' consumer fiber operations for approximately $5.5 billion. A formal bid could be announced this week, which would significantly expand AT&T's FTTH^[Fiber to the Home] footprint[2][4].

- **Subscriber Growth**: Financial analysts at TD Cowen projected AT&T would gain 254,000 additional postpaid phone customers in Q1 2025, showing continued momentum in its wireless business[2].

### T-Mobile

- **Lumos Networks Acquisition Completed**: T-Mobile and investment company EQT finalized their joint venture to acquire FTTH provider Lumos Networks. T-Mobile invested $950 million for a 50% equity stake, with plans to invest an additional $500 million between 2027-2028 to support expansion. The carrier aims to reach 3.5 million homes by the end of 2028[4].

- **Strong Subscriber Performance**: T-Mobile reported positive subscriber growth, continuing its upward trajectory in contrast to some competitors. TD Cowen analysts had predicted T-Mobile would add approximately 500,000 postpaid phone customers in Q1 2025[2][3].

- **M&A Strategy**: T-Mobile's CEO indicated a preference for "pureplay fiber" acquisitions as part of the company's M&A strategy, signaling continued interest in expanding its fiber footprint beyond recent acquisitions[3].

- **US Cellular Acquisition**: The regulatory approval clock for T-Mobile's acquisition of US Cellular is winding down, with only days remaining for a decision. Industry observers are leaning toward approval with additional conditions related to rural coverage commitments[5].

### Verizon

- **Subscriber Losses**: Verizon reported losing 289,000 postpaid phone customers in Q1 2025, slightly worse than analyst predictions of 308,000 losses in its consumer business. This continues a challenging trend for the carrier in the consumer wireless segment[2][3].

- **Stock Upgrade**: Despite subscriber challenges, financial analysts at Evercore upgraded Verizon's stock to "outperform," citing undervaluation and potential upside from the pending Frontier Communications acquisition. Analysts believe Verizon isn't receiving sufficient credit for its wireless service revenue growth outlook and fiber initiatives[2].

- **Frontier Acquisition Progress**: Verizon continues to work toward closing its $20 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications, which would add 2.2 million fiber subscribers to its base and significantly enhance its fiber footprint[4].

### Charter Communications

- **Wireless Growth Leader**: Charter is emerging as a powerhouse in the U.S. wireless industry, outpacing even T-Mobile in wireless subscriber growth during Q1 2025. This performance highlights the increasing competitive threat from cable companies in the wireless space[3].

## Fiber Expansion Race

All three major carriers are aggressively pursuing fiber assets as they look to:
1. Expand into new service areas
2. Strengthen backhaul for their mobile services
3. Diversify revenue streams beyond wireless

This "fiber binge" includes T-Mobile's investments in Lumos and Metronet, AT&T's potential Lumen acquisition and Gigapower joint venture with BlackRock Alternative, and Verizon's pending Frontier Communications deal[4].

The telecommunications landscape continues to evolve rapidly as traditional boundaries between wireless, wireline, and cable providers blur in the
