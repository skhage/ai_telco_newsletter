### News and Announcements in Data Technology for U.S. Telecoms This Week

#### **1. U.S. Telecom and Cable 2025 Outlook: Convergence, Consolidation, and Disruption**
- **Key Themes for 2025:**
  - **FTTH Deployments:** Expectations are high for accelerated FTTH (Fiber-to-the-Home) deployments in 2025, with companies like Lumos Fiber and MetroNet receiving fresh capital from T-Mobile and its partners to accelerate their expansion plans[1].
  - **M&A and Shareholder Returns:** Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) along with shareholder returns are expected to limit credit metric improvement for U.S. telcos in 2025. Despite lower levels of capital expenditure (capex) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) growth, carriers face headwinds from higher interest expenses and cash taxes. However, free operating cash flow (FOCF) remains healthy, and leverage has declined in 2024[1].
  - **Carrier Capex Projections:**
    - **Verizon:** Capex is expected to increase by around $1 billion in 2025, primarily due to an increase in FTTH passings by about 650,000 from 500,000 in 2024. FOCF is expected to modestly decrease but remain around $18 billion[1].
    - **AT&T:** Capex is relatively flat as lower vendor financing payments are offset by a modest expansion of its FTTH passings to around 2.7 million from 2.5 million in 2024. FOCF is expected to decline to around $16 billion, primarily reflecting the loss of distributions from DirecTV, although this is partially offset by payments from TPG to buy the remaining stake of DTV that it didn't own[1].
    - **T-Mobile:** A modest increase in capex reflecting incremental spending from US Cellular in the second half of 2025 but remaining in the $9 billion to $10 billion area. FOCF is expected to increase to around $17.5 billion in 2025 from $17 billion in 2024[1].

#### **2. Latest US Wireless Carrier Report Shows T-Mobile Dominating Verizon and AT&T**
- **OpenSignal Wireless Report:**
  - T-Mobile has significantly outperformed Verizon and AT&T in various metrics, including 5G availability and download speed experience. According to OpenSignal, T-Mobile users experience 5G roughly 72% of the time, while AT&T customers see it around 15% and Verizon subscribers around 10%[2].
  - The report highlights that T-Mobile's strong performance in 5G availability directly contributes to its higher download speeds, as customers are more frequently connected to the faster 5G network[2].

#### **3. Chinese Hackers Breach Multiple U.S. Telecom Networks**
- **Salt Typhoon Hacks:**
  - Chinese state-backed hackers known as Salt Typhoon have breached the networks of several U.S. telecom companies, including AT&T, Verizon, Lumen Technologies, Charter Communications, Windstream, and Consolidated Communications[3][5].
  - The hackers gained access to targeted individuals' text messages, voicemails, and phone calls as well as wiretap information of those investigated by U.S. law enforcement[3][5].
  - T-Mobile also disclosed a breach involving some of its routers in a network reconnaissance attempt but stated that its cyber defenses stopped the attack[3][5].

#### **4. AT&T and Verizon Tipped to Roll Out 5G SA in 2025**
- **5G Standalone (SA) Rollout:**
  - AT&T and Verizon are expected to roll out 5G SA in 2025, which will include a new and improved core network with advanced features like network slicing[4].
  - This move is seen as a significant step towards enhancing the capabilities of their 5G networks[4].

#### **5. FCC Orders Telecoms to Secure Their Networks After Salt Typhoon Hacks**
- **FCC Response:**
  - In response to the Salt Typhoon hacks, the FCC has ordered U.S. telecom companies to enhance their network security measures[5].
  - The U.S. authorities are also considering banning China Telecom's last active operations in the United States and TP-Link routers if an ongoing investigation shows their use in cyberattacks poses a national security risk[5].
