### Key Industry Trends and News for the Week

#### Robocall Mitigation Efforts
- **TNS 2025 Robocall Report**: Top US telecom providers (Verizon, UScellular, T-Mobile, Lumen, Comcast, Charter, and AT&T) have made significant progress in maximizing the benefits of STIR/SHAKEN implementation. The report by Transaction Network Services (TNS) shows that 86% of all traffic between these tier-1 carriers was signed throughout the year, helping to protect their subscribers from unwanted robocalls [1]. Additionally, 95% of call traffic between these top carriers was signed with 'A level' attestation, enabling operators to establish SIP-to-SIP connections and prevent robocall bad actors from infiltrating tier-1 networks. However, the percentage of signed calls between non-top carriers fell by nearly 25% in 2024 due to the exploitation of legacy TDM circuits and the dropping of original STIR/SHAKEN information.

#### Satellite-Based Services
- **T-Mobile Starlink Expansion**: T-Mobile has expanded its free Starlink trial to include customers from AT&T and Verizon. The service uses SpaceX’s low Earth orbit (LEO) Starlink satellites to provide coverage in areas where terrestrial infrastructure is lacking. The service is currently in its public beta phase and will be free for all users until its commercial launch in July. After that, users will have the option to access Starlink’s direct-to-device services for an additional fee ($15 per month for T-Mobile customers and $20 per month for AT&T/Verizon customers) [2][4].

#### Cybersecurity Concerns
- **Salt Typhoon Breach**: A series of cyber-espionage attacks linked to Salt Typhoon have targeted major US telecom providers including Verizon, AT&T, Lumen, Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications, and Windstream. These breaches exploited vulnerabilities in their networks to access unencrypted communications, intercepting sensitive data such as text messages, voicemails, and phone calls. The FBI, NSA, and CISA have issued urgent warnings and released detailed mitigation strategies to help companies shore up their defenses. Legislative efforts are also gaining momentum with Senator Ron Wyden proposing a telecom security bill to close systemic vulnerabilities [3].
