### Key Data Technology Trends in US Telecom (Week of December 8-14, 2025)

The US telecommunications sector saw continued momentum in **fiber network expansion**, **acquisition activity**, and **spectrum deployments** as operators position for 2026 growth amid AI-driven power constraints and satellite integration. **Consolidation** via mergers and joint ventures dominated, with **AT&T's Lumen acquisition** nearing completion and **open-access fiber models** gaining traction through partnerships like T-Mobile's explorations.[1][3] Fixed wireless access (FWA) faced capacity strains, evidenced by median downlink speed drops across major carriers from Q1 to Q3 2025, while **direct-to-device (D2D) satellite services** advanced commercially.[5][6] Energy efficiency emerged as a bottleneck for data-intensive networks, prompting investments in renewables and upgrades.[1]

### AT&T
AT&T accelerated its **fiber strategy** and spectrum utilization, reinforcing its position as a leader in broadband expansion. The company is advancing toward finalizing its **$5.75 billion acquisition of Lumen’s mass markets fiber assets**, announced recently and expected to close in 2026, enhancing its **FTTH^^[Fiber to the Home]** footprint and operational synergies.[1][3] AT&T gained early access to **EchoStar's 3.45 GHz mid-band spectrum** and moved quickly to deploy it, bolstering mid-band capacity for 5G data services.[3] In Q4, AT&T added **280,000 new fiber subscribers**—a 3.3% year-over-year increase and its 12th straight quarter exceeding 200,000 additions—viewing fiber as pivotal to long-term success amid legacy copper declines.[3] The firm committed **$14 billion to energy-efficient network upgrades** to address AI workloads and rising power costs, treating energy as a core capacity-planning factor.[1] Additionally, AT&T was impacted by the 2024 **Salt Typhoon Chinese espionage hacks** (disclosed October 2024), alongside peers, though recent FCC rollbacks on telco cybersecurity rules noted carriers' improved postures.[4]

### T-Mobile
T-Mobile focused on **FWA scaling**, **fiber partnerships**, and **spectrum deals** to extend its data leadership. The carrier instituted a **soft data cap on fixed wireless**, updating prioritization for its 5 million FWA subscribers to manage high usage and mitigate speeds dropping amid capacity crunch.[3][6] T-Mobile explored **open-access fiber deals**, including talks with Tillman FiberCo as an anchor tenant and trials in select markets, aligning with industry joint ventures like its Metronet/Lumos partnership.[1][3] It struck a **mutual spectrum agreement with Comcast**, leasing 71 licenses in the **600 MHz band** covering 149 million people to boost low-band coverage for data services.[3] T-Mobile launched the **first commercial D2D messaging service** in the US via SpaceX/Starlink, with FCC conditional approval for “Supplemental Coverage from Space” enabling spectrum reuse; by Q3, 600 satellites supported this, with partners like Rogers and KDDI.[1][5] Like peers, T-Mobile faced FWA speed declines and was hit by Salt Typhoon hacks.[4][6] A watchdog recommended clarifying its **Price Lock claim** following an AT&T challenge.[3]

### Verizon
Verizon emphasized **brand evolution**, **FWA adjustments**, and pending acquisitions amid operational challenges. It rolled out a **brand refresh** with a new logo and launched **myHome**, an internet service augmented by smart home features to enhance data-centric customer experiences.[3] Verizon's **fixed wireless struggled**, contributing to Q3 results prompting new CEO Dan Schulman to plan major changes; median downlink speeds dropped from Q1 to Q3 amid FWA capacity exhaustion.[3][6] Key deals include the completed **$20 billion Frontier acquisition** (FCC-approved May 2025) and pending **Starry acquisition**, both expanding fiber and broadband reach for 2026.[1] Partnerships like **Verizon-Tilman** extended networks via joint ventures.[1] Verizon surpassed **1 GW in renewable power-purchase agreements** to tackle power constraints from AI/data growth.[1] It committed to **AST SpaceMobile's 2026 D2D launch** and was affected by Salt Typhoon breaches.[1][4]

### Lumen
Lumen advanced **asset monetization** to streamline its enterprise focus while offloading consumer assets. It agreed to sell its **mass markets fiber assets to AT&T for $5.75 billion**, a deal less surprising than recent peers but critical for Lumen's pivot; closure is eyed for 2026.[1][3] Reports indicated Lumen is **ready to sell its consumer fiber operations**, per Reuters, alignin
