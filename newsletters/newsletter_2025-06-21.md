## Company-Specific News

### **AT&T**
  
**Major Acquisition:**
  
AT&T announced a $5.75 billion all-cash deal to acquire Lumen’s Quantum Fiber consumer FTTH^[Fiber to the Home] business, adding nearly 1 million subscribers and about $750 million in annualized revenue[3](https://www.telecoms.com/fibre/at-t-ups-fibre-target-after-shelling-out-$5.75-billion-for-lumen)[4](https://tecknexus.com/telecom-and-tech-merger-and-acquisition-tracker-2025)[5](https://www.channelfutures.com/fiber/at-t-to-acquire-lumen-consumer-fiber-$5.75-billion). This move significantly expands AT&T’s fiber footprint and positions it for further growth in residential broadband.

**Strategic Plans:**

The acquired assets will be held under a new subsidiary (provisionally "NetworkCo"), with plans for AT&T to seek an equity partner within 6–12 months post-closing (expected H1 2026), enabling co-investment and potential monetization of the wholesale unit with AT&T as anchor tenant[3](https://www.telecoms.com/fibre/at-t-ups-fibre-target-after-shelling-out-$5.75-billion-for-lumen).
