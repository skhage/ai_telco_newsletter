### Recent Developments in U.S. Data Technology

#### Fiber Deployment and Infrastructure

- **Accelerated FTTH Deployments**: The pace of fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) deployments is expected to accelerate in 2025. Companies like Lumos Fiber and MetroNet will receive fresh capital from T-Mobile and its partners to expedite their network builds. AT&T is projected to add about 2.7 million new FTTH passings in 2025, with plans to ramp up to over 3 million passings per year thereafter. Verizon added approximately 500,000 homes in 2024 but is expected to accelerate its build pace to 650,000 in 2025. T-Mobile's joint ventures are anticipated to add about 1 million new passings in 2025, expanding their fiber footprint to around 10 million by 2028 [1].

#### Mergers and Acquisitions

- **Verizon's Acquisition of Frontier**: Verizon is set to acquire Frontier Communications, which will add about 7 million fiber passings to its footprint. This acquisition will enable Verizon to bundle in-home broadband and mobile services across a wider footprint, enhancing its competitiveness against incumbent cable providers [1].

- **T-Mobile's US Cellular Acquisition**: T-Mobile plans to acquire the mobile operations of US Cellular and 30% of its spectrum license holdings in a transaction valued at $4.4 billion. This move will expand T-Mobile's scale and allow it to extract material synergies [1].

- **Lumos and MetroNet Acquisitions**: T-Mobile has announced joint-venture partnerships with private equity sponsors to acquire Lumos and MetroNet. These acquisitions aim to expand T-Mobile's FTTH footprint to cover 12 to 15 million passings over the long term [1].

#### Cybersecurity Concerns

- **Chinese Cyberattack**: Several U.S. telecommunications companies, including AT&T, Lumen, and Verizon, have confirmed that they were breached by Chinese state-backed hackers. Other affected companies include Windstream, Consolidated Communications, and Charter Communications. These breaches highlight ongoing cybersecurity threats in the U.S. telecommunications sector [3].

#### Network Upgrades and Shutdowns

- **T-Mobile's 2G Network Shutdown**: T-Mobile has set a final shutdown date for its aging 2G network on February 9, 2025. Eligible users can exchange their 2G devices for a free 5G phone by visiting T-Mobile stores. The carrier plans to repurpose the 2G spectrum to improve 4G and 5G coverage across the U.S. This move aligns with T-Mobile's strategy to focus solely on LTE and 5G services [2].

#### Pricing Adjustments

- **Verizon's Price Hike**: Verizon is raising prices on its family plans with five or more lines starting February 20, 2025. The discount per line will drop by $3 per line, resulting in at least a $15 monthly increase for five-line accounts. Single-line accounts will see a $4 monthly increase as an access fee, while multi-line shared plans will experience an additional $15 monthly access fee. Additionally, Verizon is increasing its data overage charge from $15 per GB to $20 per GB [4].

#### Capital Expenditures

- **Telco Capex Trends**: U.S. telco capital expenditures (capex) are expected to increase modestly in 2025 by around 3%. This increase will primarily support FTTH builds rather than wireless network upgrades. Verizon's capex is expected to increase modestly to support FTTH deployments, while T-Mobile's capex will see a small increase assuming it closes on its acquisition of US Cellular in the second half of 2025. AT&T's capex remains relatively flat, and Lumen's capex is expected to increase around $200 million for new private connectivity fabric (PCF) deals [1].

These developments highlight the ongoing evolution of data technology in the United States, with a focus on fiber infrastructure expansion, strategic acquisitions, cybersecurity concerns, network upgrades, and pricing adjustments.
