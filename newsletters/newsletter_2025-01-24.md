### Week in Review: Data Technology Trends in the U.S. Telecom Industry

#### **AT&T**
- **Fiber Expansion**: AT&T is expected to add about 2.7 million fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) passings in 2025, a modest expansion from the 2.5 million passings in 2024. This expansion is part of a broader strategy to protect its legacy copper infrastructure and improve its broadband capabilities[1].
- **DirecTV Acquisition**: Although AT&T's planned acquisition of Dish DBS Corp. was terminated due to lender rejection of a subpar debt exchange, TPG Capital announced its intention to purchase the remaining 70% stake in DirecTV that it didn't own[1].

#### **T-Mobile**
- **US Cellular Acquisition**: T-Mobile plans to acquire the mobile operations of US Cellular and 30% of its spectrum license holdings in a transaction valued at $4.4 billion. This acquisition will expand T-Mobile's scale and enable it to extract material synergies[1].
- **Fiber Expansion JVs**: T-Mobile has announced joint ventures with private equity sponsors to acquire Lumos and MetroNet, aiming to expand its FTTH footprint to cover 12 to 15 million passings longer term. These JVs will accelerate the build pace of fiber networks, adding about 1 million new passings in 2025[1].
- **5G Dominance**: According to an OpenSignal report, T-Mobile significantly outperforms Verizon and AT&T in terms of 5G availability, with T-Mobile users experiencing 5G roughly 72% of the time compared to AT&T's 15% and Verizon's 10%[2].

#### **Verizon**
- **Frontier Acquisition**: Verizon is proposing the acquisition of Frontier, which will add about 7 million fiber passings to its footprint. This acquisition will enable Verizon to bundle in-home broadband and mobile services to a wider footprint, better competing with incumbent cable providers[1].
- **Fiber Expansion**: Verizon added about 500,000 homes in 2024 and is expected to accelerate its build pace to 650,000 in 2025. The company is also investing in FTTH builds, with capex increasing modestly to support these efforts[1].
- **Wireless Home Internet**: Verizon is focusing on expanding its wireless home internet services, aiming to upgrade its network infrastructure with higher capacity fiber circuits to improve the overall wireless experience for customers[4].

#### **Lumen**
- **PCF Deals**: Lumen has secured about $8 billion in deals to provide custom fiber networks for hyperscalers and other technology companies. These deals will bolster Lumen's liquidity position and give it greater financial flexibility to integrate network and IT systems over the next couple of years. There are also about $3.5 billion of potential new deals being negotiated[1].
- **Capex Increase**: Lumen's capex is expected to increase around $200 million in 2025 due to new PCF deals, although its consumer business remains relatively small compared to its communication and networking services for larger business customers[1].

#### **Charter Communications**
- **Security Breach**: Charter Communications, along with Windstream and Consolidated Communications, has been breached by Chinese state-backed hackers known as Salt Typhoon. The hackers gained access to targeted individuals' text messages, voicemails, and phone calls, as well as wiretap information of those investigated by U.S. law enforcement[3][5].

### Summary
