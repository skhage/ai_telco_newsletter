### Key Data Technology Trends in US Telecom (Week of Dec 27, 2025 - Jan 2, 2026)

The past week highlighted intensifying competition in **fixed wireless access (FWA)** and fiber deployments as carriers leverage 5G and mid-band spectrum to challenge cable broadband dominance, with **AT&T**, **T-Mobile**, and **Verizon** expanding wireless home internet amid cable operators like **Charter** facing subscriber losses and pursuing mergers for scale [1](https://techblog.comsoc.org/category/cable-broadband-access/) [2](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/). Regulatory shifts, including **BEAD** program disruptions and **CBRS** spectrum debates, added uncertainty to fiber funding and mid-band 5G evolution, while enterprise fiber deals underscored a pivot toward high-capacity data infrastructure [2](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/) [7](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/what-s-the-state-of-play-for-cbrs-). CAPEX surges for network upgrades, symmetrical speeds, and AI-driven services reflected broader investments in data throughput and edge computing to counter **ACP** funding cliffs and satellite threats [1](https://techblog.comsoc.org/category/cable-broadband-access/).

### AT&T
AT&T accelerated its **FWA** push with **Internet Air** expansions into 16 new markets, positioning it to rival T-Mobile and Verizon in wireless broadband delivery over 5G networks [2](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/). The company gained early access to EchoStar’s **3.45 GHz mid-band spectrum** from a pending $23 billion acquisition, enabling faster **5G** deployments for enhanced data capacity in urban and suburban areas [2](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/). AT&T views its fiber strategy as pivotal for long-term data growth, adding 280,000 fiber subscribers in recent quarters—marking 12 straight quarters over 200,000—while advocating **CBRS** spectrum reforms via incentive auctions to prioritize high-power 5G over incumbents [2](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/) [7](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/what-s-the-state-of-play-for-cbrs-). Litigation ended against an industry watchdog over a Luke Wilson ad campaign, clearing focus for data tech priorities [8](https://www.law360.com/telecom). AT&T also chipped away at Verizon's market share with steady wireless gains, though ARPU declined for eight quarters amid promotional subsidies [1](https://techblog.comsoc.org/category/cable-broadband-access/) [3](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/best-communication-services-stocks-buy).

### T-Mobile
T-Mobile dominated FWA news, imposing a soft data cap on its 5 million **5G Home Internet** subscribers via updated prioritization, potentially slowing speeds for heavy users to manage network congestion [2](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/). Talks emerged for T-Mobile to anchor a new open-access **fiber network** with Tillman FiberCo, signaling wireline ambitions alongside wireless data leadership [2](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/). A spectrum deal with Comcast leased 71 **600 MHz** licenses covering 149 million people, bolstering low-band coverage for reliable data services [2](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/). T-Mobile renewed its contract with Altice for aggressive mobile pricing, allowing Altice to advertise T-Mobile's network explicitly—a novel term—while growing ARPU via **Magenta Max** plans and leading industry gross adds with falling churn post-Sprint integration [1](https://techblog.comsoc.org/category/cable-broadband-access/). A watchdog recommended clarifying its "Price Lock" claim after an AT&T challenge, amid Q3 2025 revenue up 8.9% year-over-year [2](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/) [9](https://csimarket.com/stocks/compet_glance.php?code=TMUS). Charter noted T-Mobile's FWA as a "significant" threat across its full footprint [1](https://techblog.comsoc.org/category/cable-broadband-access/).

### Verizon
Verizon's **FWA** efforts faltered per Q3 results, prompting new CEO Dan Schulman to outline major changes, including a brand refresh with a new logo and **myHome** launch—a bundled internet service augmented by smart home data tools [2](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/). Wireless home broadband using **5G** racked up millions of customers at competitive speeds and prices versus cable, pressuring Charter (which lost 60,000 internet subs in a recent quarter) and covering 100% o
