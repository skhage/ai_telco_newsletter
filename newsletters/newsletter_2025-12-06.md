AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Lumen, and Charter all spent the past week positioning around **spectrum, broadband access, and the shifting balance between fiber and 5G FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access]**, with new research reinforcing that **cable broadband will keep shrinking even as total U.S. broadband grows**.[3](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/04/new-street-research-study-cable-broadband-will-continue-its-decline-but-total-broadband-access-subscribers-will-increase/)  

Below is a company-by-company rundown, focused on U.S. data technology moves and implications.

## Cross-industry data & broadband trends

- A new **New Street Research** study this week projects that **cable broadband net adds will stay negative through at least 2030**, even as total U.S. broadband subscribers continue to rise.[3](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/04/new-street-research-study-cable-broadband-will-continue-its-decline-but-total-broadband-access-subscribers-will-increase/)  
- Growth is expected to come from:
  - **Fiber**: AT&T Fiber, Verizon Fios, Frontier and Lumen Fiber are highlighted as outperformers.[3](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/04/new-street-research-study-cable-broadband-will-continue-its-decline-but-total-broadband-access-subscribers-will-increase/)
  - **5G FWA**: T-Mobile and Verizon in particular, with strong customer satisfaction and rapid adoption.[3](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/04/new-street-research-study-cable-broadband-will-continue-its-decline-but-total-broadband-access-subscribers-will-increase/)

New Street expects **U.S. FWA subs to reach 32–36 million**, with **2026 FWA net adds of 3.6 million**:  
- **T-Mobile**: ~1.7 million adds  
- **Verizon**: ~1.0 million adds  
- **AT&T**: ~0.9 million adds[3](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/04/new-street-research-study-cable-broadband-will-continue-its-decline-but-total-broadband-access-subscribers-will-increase/)  

The analysts estimate carriers have already consumed about **55% of their current FWA capacity**, before any new upper C‑Band spectrum, which could support another ~4 million FWA subs.[3](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/04/new-street-research-study-cable-broadband-will-continue-its-decline-but-total-broadband-access-subscribers-will-increase/)

## AT&T

### 1. EchoStar spectrum strategy and 5G capacity

- **AT&T doubled down this week on its plan to access EchoStar spectrum**, a move aimed squarely at bolstering mid‑band 5G capacity for both **mobility and FWA**.[5](https://www.lightreading.com/network-technology/broadband)  
- **T-Mobile formally objected**, signaling an intensifying spectrum-policy fight that directly affects AT&T’s ability to scale 5G data services and FWA in dense markets.[5](https://www.lightreading.com/network-technology/broadband)

Strategic implications for data technology:
- Additional mid‑band spectrum would:
  - Increase **5G capacity per cell**, improving **home broadband via FWA** and enterprise data services.
  - Help support New Street’s projection that AT&T can add **~900k FWA subs next year** while staying within capacity limits.[3](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/04/new-street-research-study-cable-broadband-will-continue-its-decline-but-total-broadband-access-subscribers-will-increase/)
- New Street notes that **AT&T is using FWA as an on-ramp to fiber**, with a long‑term goal of **converting FWA customers to AT&T Fiber** as its fiber footprint expands.[1](https://techblog.comsoc.org/category/broadband-access-subscriber-growth/)

### 2. Broadband positioning vs cable

- AT&T is cited among the **telcos rapidly expanding FTTP^[Fiber to the Premises]**, offering **symmetric speeds and lower latency** that pressure cable HFC^[Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial] offerings.[1](https://techblog.comsoc.org/category/broadband-access-subscriber-growth
