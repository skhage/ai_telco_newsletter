**Key Industry Trends (Week of August 28, 2025)**

- **Cybersecurity remains a top concern** as major U.S. telecoms including AT&T, Verizon, Lumen, and Charter Communications were confirmed victims of a large-scale Chinese-backed hacking campaign, highlighting persistent vulnerabilities in core network infrastructure[3](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/fbi-says-chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-at-least-200-us-companies/).
- **Robocall mitigation efforts** are showing strong results among tier-1 carriers, with 84% of inter-carrier call traffic now signed and verified using STIR/SHAKEN^[Secure Telephone Identity Revisited/Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs] protocols, but smaller carriers lag behind, leaving gaps for bad actors[1](https://tnsi.com/resource/com/tns-half-year-2025-robocall-report-bad-actors-exploiting-non-ip-networks-of-smaller-carriers-press-release/).
- **Fiber deployment and network upgrades** continue to accelerate, with major carriers exceeding targets for new fiber passings and expanding all-IP^[Internet Protocol] infrastructure[4](https://www.mobileworldlive.com/att/analysis-who-is-winning-t-mobile-att-verizons-fibre-brawl/).
- **Industry consolidation and spectrum realignment** are ongoing, as EchoStar exits the facilities-based MNO^[Mobile Network Operator] market by selling spectrum to AT&T, signaling further shifts in the competitive landscape[5](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/echostar-s-future-as-a-facilities-based-wireless-carrier-is-toast-amid-spectrum-sale-to-at-t).
