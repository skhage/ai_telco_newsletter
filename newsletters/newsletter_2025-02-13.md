### Week in Review: Data Technology Trends in the United States

#### **AT&T**

- **FTTH Deployments**: AT&T is expected to add about 2.7 million fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) passings in 2025, ramping up to over 3 million passings per year thereafter [1].
- **Capex and FOCF**: AT&T's capital expenditures (capex) are relatively flat, offset by a modest expansion of its FTTH passings. Free operating cash flow (FOCF) is expected to decline to around $16 billion in 2025, primarily reflecting the loss of distributions from DirecTV, although this is partially offset by payments from TPG to buy the remaining stake of DTV [1].
- **M&A Activity**: AT&T was involved in a proposed acquisition of Dish DBS Corp., but the deal was terminated after lenders rejected a subpar debt exchange [1].

#### **T-Mobile**

- **FTTH Deployments**: T-Mobile's joint ventures are expected to add about 1 million FTTH passings in 2025, expanding their fiber footprint to around 10 million by 2028. This expansion includes partnerships with Lumos and MetroNet [1].
- **Capex and FOCF**: T-Mobile's capex is expected to increase modestly, reflecting incremental spending from US Cellular in the second half of 2025. FOCF is expected to increase to around $17.5 billion in 2025 from $17 billion in 2024 [1].
- **M&A Activity**: T-Mobile plans to acquire the mobile operations of US Cellular and 30% of its spectrum license holdings in a transaction valued at $4.4 billion [1].
- **Starlink Marketing Stunt**: T-Mobile launched a marketing campaign offering free text messaging via Starlink to Verizon and AT&T customers until July, with a $20/month fee thereafter. This move aims to disrupt the satellite messaging market and attract new customers [2][4].

#### **Verizon**

- **FTTH Deployments**: Verizon added about 500,000 homes to its FTTH network in 2024 and is expected to accelerate its build pace to 650,000 in 2025 prior to closing on its proposed acquisition of Frontier [1].
- **Capex and FOCF**: Verizon's capex is expected to increase by around $1 billion in 2025, partially due to an increase in FTTH passings. FOCF is expected to remain around $18 billion in 2025 [1].
- **M&A Activity**: Verizon proposed acquiring Frontier Communications, which would add about 7 million fiber passings to its footprint [1].

#### **Lumen**

- **Capex and Business Strategy**: Lumen's capex is expected to increase by around $200 million for new private connectivity fabric (PCF) deals. The company derives most of its revenue from communication and networking services for larger business customers, which are in secular decline. However, recent business wins from hyperscalers could help improve its financial position [1].
- **AI and Data Demand**: Lumen has secured about $8 billion in deals to provide custom fiber networks for AI data demand, which will bolster its liquidity position and give it greater financial flexibility [1].

#### **Charter Communications**

- **Not Mentioned in Recent Announcements**: Charter Communications was not mentioned in the recent announcements related to data technology trends in the United States.

### Key Trends

1. **Accelerating FTTH Deployments**:
   - All major carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon) are expected to accelerate their FTTH deployments in 2025, with significant increases in passings [1].

2. **M&A Activity**:
   - The telecom industry saw a rise in M&A deals in 2024, driven by factors like lower borrowing costs, rising equity prices, and the need for scale [1].

3. **Robocall Mitigation Efforts**:
   - Top US telecom providers (Verizon, UScellular, T-Mobile, Lumen, Comcast, Charter, and AT&T) continue to make progress in maximizing the benefits of STIR/SHAKEN implementation, with 86% of all traffic between these tier-1 carriers signed throughout the year [3].

4. **Starlink Marketing Stunt**:
   - T-Mobile's marketing campaign offering free text messaging via Starlink to Verizon and AT&T customers has generated significant attention, highlighting T-Mobile's time-to-market advantage in the satellite messaging wars [2][4].
