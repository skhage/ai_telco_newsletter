### Key Industry Trends

1. **Robocall Mitigation Efforts**
   - The Transaction Network Services (TNS) 2025 Robocall Investigation Report highlights significant progress in robocall mitigation efforts by top US telecom providers. The report shows that 86% of all traffic between tier-1 carriers (Verizon, UScellular, T-Mobile, Lumen, Comcast, Charter, and AT&T) was signed throughout the year, helping to protect subscribers from unwanted robocalls [1][2].
   - However, despite this progress, non-top carriers saw a nearly 25% decline in signed calls in 2024. Robocall bad actors exploited legacy TDM circuits and dropped STIR/SHAKEN information to hide malicious traffic [1][2].

2. **Cybersecurity Threats**
   - A recent cyberattack by the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group Salt Typhoon has compromised several major US telecom providers, including Verizon, AT&T, Lumen, Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications, and Windstream. The breaches targeted unencrypted communications like text messages and voicemails, leaving millions vulnerable to data theft and surveillance [3].

3. **5G Expansion Strategies**
   - AT&T, T-Mobile US, and Verizon have taken different approaches to expanding their rural 5G footprints. Each carrier's strategy is driven by their midband spectrum holdings. While all three carriers have expanded their rural 5G coverage over the past five years, their methods vary significantly [5].
