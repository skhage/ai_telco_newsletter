# Data Technology Trends: Week of January 12-18, 2026

## Key Industry Trends

The telecommunications sector faces a critical infrastructure crisis as **wireless contractors report widespread financial strain**, with 80% stating that carrier-offered rates don't cover operational costs[1]. This monopsony market—where AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon collectively control 97% of the cellular market—is driving contractor workforce attrition and raising national security concerns about future 6G^[Sixth Generation Wireless] deployment capacity[1]. Meanwhile, the industry is pivoting toward **fiber-focused consolidation**, with major carriers pursuing additional fiber assets to support convergence strategies[2], and **robocall prevention is entering a critical phase** as STIR/SHAKEN^[Secure Telephone Identity Revisited/Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs] protocols face exploitation by AI-enabled bad actors[4].

## Company News

### AT&T

AT&T continues aggressive portfolio reshaping amid competitive pressures, with reports indicating the carrier is pursuing a **$5.5 billion bid for Lumen's retail fiber business**[1]. The company is simultaneously ramping up network infrastructure and adding subscribers while reshaping its portfolio[3]. However, AT&T faces contractor relations challenges: the carrier pays only 15% of invoices within 30 days, with more than 45% of invoices remaining unpaid beyond 60 days—the slowest payment performance among the three national carriers[1]. This payment lag is exacerbating financial pressure on the contractor workforce supporting AT&T's infrastructure projects.

### T-Mobile

T-Mobile's contractor payment performance significantly lags industry standards, with only 17% of invoices paid within 30 days according to recent Brattle Group analysis[1]. The carrier is pursuing **fiber-focused M&A^[Mergers and Acquisitions]** to complement its convergence strategy[2], positioning itself alongside AT&T and Verizon in the broader industry shift toward integrated fiber and wireless services. T-Mobile's payment practices contribute to the broader monopsony dynamics affecting the wireless contractor market.

### Verizon

Verizon demonstrates superior contractor payment practices compared to peers, paying 75% of invoices within 30 days[1]—substantially better than AT&T and T-Mobile. The carrier is also pursuing **fiber asset acquisitions** as part of its convergence strategy[2], aligning with industry-wide trends toward integrated service delivery. Verizon's more favorable payment terms may provide competitive advantage in contractor retention amid the sector's workforce challenges.

### Lumen

Lumen is at the center of significant M&A^[Mergers and Acquisitions] activity, with AT&T reportedly preparing a **$5.5 billion bid for the company's retail fiber business**[1]. Additionally, Lumen faces regulatory scrutiny related to robocall prevention, as the FCC issued a Notice of Apparent Liability against Lingo Telecom (a Lumen-affiliated entity) for applying improper "A"-level attestations to 3,978 spoofed robocalls carrying deepfake AI^[Artificial Intelligence] voice messages[4].

### Charter Communications

Charter is executing a **major merger with Cox Communications**, representing significant consolidation in the cable sector[5]. The company has deployed **$922 million in CBRS^[Citizens Broadband Radio Service] spectrum**, converting it into strand-mounted small cells to reduce dependency on Verizon for mobile backhaul[6]. This infrastructure investment fundamentally changes Charter's network architecture and positions the company to compete more independently in wireless services. However, Charter's mobile growth—historically the bright spot for cable operators—faces headwinds from underlying network provider pressures[5].

## Broader Context

The contractor workforce crisis represents an emerging **national security concern**, as the loss of experienced tower climbers and technicians threatens emergency response capabilities and future 6G deployment readiness[1]. The fiber construction industry, by contrast, benefits from hundreds of competing companies, though consolidation risks may emerge once government grant spending concludes[1]. The robocall prevention landscape is simultaneously evolving, with only 84% of call traffic between Tier-1 operators properly signed and verified, compared to just 21% from non-tier-1 carriers, exposing vulnerabilities that bad actors are actively exploiting with AI-generated synthetic voices[4].
