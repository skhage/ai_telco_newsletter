### Week in Review: Data Technology Trends in the United States

#### **Telecom Industry Outlook and Mergers & Acquisitions**

- **U.S. Telecom and Cable 2025 Outlook: Convergence, Consolidation, and Disruption**
  - **Key Themes for 2025**:
    - The U.S. telecom industry is expected to see significant convergence and consolidation in 2025, driven by the need for scale and improved broadband capabilities.
    - Major carriers like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are investing heavily in Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) deployments, with Verizon planning to add 650,000 new FTTH passings in 2025, AT&T aiming for 2.7 million passings, and T-Mobile targeting around 1 million passings through its joint ventures.
    - Despite these investments, M&A activities will continue to shape the industry, with Verizon's proposed acquisition of Frontier Communications and T-Mobile's acquisition of US Cellular's mobile operations being notable examples.
    - Lumen's consumer business remains a smaller segment, but the company is securing significant deals with hyperscalers to provide custom fiber networks, bolstering its liquidity and financial flexibility.

#### **T-Mobile's 2G Network Shutdown**

- **T-Mobile Sets Final Shutdown Date for Its Aging 2G Network**
  - T-Mobile has announced that it will shut down its 2G network on February 9, 2025, after multiple delays.
  - Eligible users can exchange their 2G devices for a free 5G phone by visiting T-Mobile stores.
  - The company plans to repurpose the 2G spectrum to improve 4G and 5G coverage across the U.S., making it the last carrier in the U.S. still offering a 2G network.

#### **Robocall Mitigation Efforts**

- **TNS 2025 Robocall Report: Top Carriers' Signed Traffic Success Enhances Robocall Mitigation Efforts**
  - Top U.S. telecom providers (Verizon, UScellular, T-Mobile, Lumen, Comcast, Charter, and AT&T) have made significant progress in implementing STIR/SHAKEN, which has helped protect subscribers from unwanted robocalls.
  - The report shows that 86% of all traffic between these tier-1 carriers was signed throughout the year, with 95% of call traffic signed with 'A level' attestation.
  - However, non-top carriers' networks remain at risk due to the exploitation of legacy TDM circuits by robocall bad actors.

#### **Super Bowl 2025 Network Upgrades**

- **Super Bowl 2025 â€” Here's What the Big Carriers Are Doing to Amp Up Their Networks**
  - Major carriers are upgrading their networks for Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans:
    - **AT&T**: Upgrading its distributed antenna system (DAS) and adding new small cell nodes with C-Band overlaying 69 existing nodes. AT&T is also deploying 11 'Cells on Wheels' (COWs) for temporary boosts.
    - **T-Mobile**: Refreshing its stadium antenna system and boasting major cell sites near the Superdome supporting downloads up to 920Mbps. T-Mobile is also deploying one COW and a SAT/COLT for NFL broadcasts.
    - **Verizon**: Promising high-speed C-Band and Ultra Wideband 5G in every seat, suite, and concourse in the stadium. Verizon is also rolling out new fiber optic infrastructure covering highly frequented areas like the Smoothie King Arena, airport, convention center, and Bourbon Street.

These announcements highlight the ongoing efforts of major telecom providers in the U.S. to enhance their data technology infrastructure, improve network reliability, and combat emerging threats like robocalls. The focus on FTTH deployments and network upgrades underscores the industry's commitment to providing superior broadband services as demand continues to grow.
