# Data Technology Trends: Week of November 24-28, 2025

The telecommunications industry continues its aggressive consolidation and infrastructure expansion strategy, with major carriers doubling down on fiber-to-the-home (FTTH^[Fiber to the Home]) and fixed wireless access (FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access]) deployments. This week's developments underscore the industry's pivot toward AI-optimized networks and the ongoing reshaping of the competitive landscape through strategic acquisitions.

## Key Industry Trends

**Broadband subscriber growth reaches historic levels.** The third quarter of 2025 marked the biggest quarterly gain yet, with over 1 million new FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access] customers added across the industry[3]. AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon account for the majority of this growth, signaling that the traditional wireline carriers have finally reversed a decade-long decline in broadband subscribers. This momentum reflects the success of FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access] as a rapid deployment alternative to fiber, particularly in underserved markets.

**AI integration becomes central to network operations.** Major carriers are embedding artificial intelligence throughout their infrastructure for automation, predictive maintenance, and real-time optimization. This trend reflects growing demand for networks capable of supporting generative AI workloads and large-scale cloud deployments[2].

**Spectrum consolidation accelerates satellite-to-terrestrial competition.** The industry is witnessing unprecedented spectrum transactions that blur traditional boundaries between satellite and terrestrial networks, with implications for direct-to-cell services and next-generation broadband delivery[2].

## Company-Specific Developments

### AT&T

AT&T continues to solidify its position as the nation's largest fiber provider following its May 2025 acquisition of Lumen's consumer fiber business for $5.75 billion, which added nearly 1 million subscribers and approximately 4 million passings to its portfolio[1]. The integration of these assets is progressing, with Lumen fiber customers transitioning to AT&T's network infrastructure[3].

In the broader competitive landscape, AT&T remains a key beneficiary of the industry's FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access] expansion, contributing significantly to the over 1 million new FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access] customers added in Q3 2025[3]. The carrier's diversified broadband strategy—combining fiber, FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access], and traditional wireline services—positions it well for sustained subscriber growth.

### T-Mobile

T-Mobile's fiber ambitions continue to accelerate through its joint venture with KKR. In September 2025, Metronet (the T-Mobile and KKR joint venture) confirmed its acquisition of U.S. Internet (USI), a Minneapolis-based pure-play fiber provider serving over 140,000 homes and businesses[2]. This transaction expands Metronet's footprint in Minnesota and complements existing operations in surrounding communities.

The integration strategy reflects T-Mobile's sophisticated approach to fiber consolidation: USI's residential customers will transition to T-Mobile Fiber for sales, marketing, and customer service, while commercial clients move under Metronet Commercial. With more than 2.6 million homes and businesses already passed across 19 states, Metronet positions itself as one of the fastest-expanding FTTH^[Fiber to the Home] providers in the nation[2].

Additionally, T-Mobile's earlier acquisition of regional ISP U.S. Internet (announced in August 2025) demonstrates the carrier's commitment to building fiber scale, with the joint venture targeting 12-15 million or more homes passed with fiber by the end of 2030[1].

### Verizon

Verizon made a significant strategic move in October 2025 by announcing plans to acquire Starry, Inc., a fixed wireless broadband provider operating in major metropolitan areas including Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Denver, and Washington, D.C.[2]. The acquisition strengthens Verizon's FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access] portfolio and enhances its ability to deliver high-speed broadband to dense urban and multi-dwelling unit (MDU^[Multi-Dwelling Unit]) environments.

Starry's millimeter-wave (mmWave^[Millimeter-Wave]) technology and urban network assets will be integrated into Verizon's extensive fiber and licensed spectrum infrastructure, accelerating cost-efficient broadband rollout across key metropolitan markets. The transaction adds approximately 100
