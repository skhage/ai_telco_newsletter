### Week in Review: Data Technology Trends in the United States

#### 1. **Cybersecurity Breaches by Chinese Hackers**

**Salt Typhoon Hackers Breach Major U.S. Telecom Companies**
- **Affected Companies:** AT&T, Verizon, Lumen Technologies, Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications, Windstream, and T-Mobile.
- **Details:** Chinese government-backed hackers known as the Salt Typhoon group have compromised multiple major U.S. telecommunications companies. The breaches provided capabilities to geolocate millions of individuals and record phone calls. The intrusions granted access to targeted individuals' text messages, voicemails, and phone calls, as well as wiretap information related to U.S. law enforcement investigations[1][3][5].
- **Response:** AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies have confirmed that they have removed the hackers from their networks. T-Mobile reported containing attempted attacks within days of detection. The U.S. government has implemented various measures, including guidance from CISA to strengthen systems against Salt Typhoon attacks and enhanced authentication protocols[1][3].

#### 2. **Verizon's 5G Speed Breakthrough**

**Verizon Shatters Speed Barriers with 5.5 Gbps Breakthrough**
- **Achievement:** Verizon has achieved unprecedented 5.5 Gbps mobile speeds using six-channel carrier aggregation technology in collaboration with Samsung Electronics and MediaTek.
- **Impact:** This advancement supports emerging trends in mobile consumption, including video calls replacing traditional voice calls, streaming entertainment, cloud gaming, and 5G private networks for factory operations[2].
- **Perspective:** The speed allows for downloading 266 Taylor Swift albums per minute or streaming 3,056 Hulu episodes per hour, demonstrating Verizon's capability to support evolving customer needs[2].

#### 3. **US Air Force Selects Verizon for 5G and 4G Network Upgrades**

**US Air Force Picks Verizon for 5G, 4G Network Upgrades**
- **Contract Award:** The US Air Force selected Verizon Business to implement 5G and 4G network improvements across 35 of its installations as part of a government upgrade program.
- **Services Provided:** Verizon is providing C-Band spectrum, new macro builds, and small cells through the agency’s offer to lease program (OTL). The upgrades will result in faster speeds, increased bandwidth, and lower latency at the installations and surrounding areas[4].

#### 4. **T-Mobile's Security Measures**

**T-Mobile Discloses Router Compromise**
- **Incident:** T-Mobile disclosed in November that unauthorized actors had compromised some of its routers in a network reconnaissance attempt initiated through a connected wireline provider’s network.
- **Response:** The company’s cyber defenses successfully stopped the attack, though it did not specifically attribute it to Salt Typhoon. T-Mobile has implemented enhanced security measures, including FIDO-based authentication protocols recommended by CISA[1][3].
