# Data Technology Industry Trends: Week of November 25 - December 2, 2025

The telecommunications sector continues to experience significant consolidation and strategic repositioning as carriers compete fiercely in broadband markets. This week's developments underscore the ongoing battle between fixed wireless access (FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access]) providers and traditional wireline operators, alongside major fiber network expansions and acquisition activity.

## Key Industry Trends

The most prominent trend dominating the sector remains the **aggressive competition between wireless carriers and cable operators** for broadband market share. Wireless carriers—particularly AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile—have fundamentally disrupted the traditional broadband landscape by deploying FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access] services at competitive price points. This shift has forced cable operators to pursue consolidation strategies and implement price-lock guarantees to retain customers[1].

Another critical trend is the **strategic pivot toward fiber infrastructure ownership**. Rather than relying solely on wireless technologies, major carriers are investing heavily in fiber-based networks through both organic build-outs and acquisitions. This dual-pronged approach reflects industry recognition that fiber represents the long-term competitive advantage in broadband delivery[1].

Price competition and customer retention initiatives have intensified significantly, with major home-internet service providers launching **multi-year price-lock guarantees** to stabilize subscriber bases and differentiate their offerings in an increasingly commoditized market[1].

## Company-Specific Developments

### AT&T

AT&T continues to execute an aggressive fiber expansion strategy that is yielding measurable results. The company has achieved a significant milestone by reaching **30 million fiber locations ahead of schedule**, demonstrating the effectiveness of its network investment strategy[3]. This acceleration positions AT&T favorably in the competitive broadband landscape and supports the company's long-term growth objectives.

In Q4 performance metrics, AT&T added **280,000 new fiber subscribers**, representing a 3.3% increase year-over-year and marking the company's **12th consecutive quarter with more than 200,000 net fiber additions**[2]. This consistent performance underscores the durability of AT&T's fiber strategy.

Additionally, AT&T has unveiled a **tailored service plan specifically targeting the 55+ demographic**, betting on affordability and security features to capture this growing market segment through bundled wireless and internet offerings[3]. This demographic-focused approach represents a strategic effort to diversify customer acquisition channels beyond traditional broadband competition.

### T-Mobile

T-Mobile's fixed wireless access strategy continues to generate substantial subscriber growth, though the company is simultaneously pursuing fiber infrastructure ownership to complement its wireless offerings. T-Mobile executives have acknowledged the company's strategic limitations, with leadership stating: "Our approach is real simple. We don't build wireline networks, you've got to know what you're not good at"[1]. This candid assessment has led to T-Mobile's acquisition strategy for fiber operators.

The company expects to close 2025 with **"well north of 3 million homes passed"** by its fiber operations and **"hopefully about 900,000 to a million customers"** on fiber services[1]. These projections reflect T-Mobile's commitment to becoming a meaningful player in the fiber broadband market through acquisitions of **Lumos and Metronet**[1].

T-Mobile's FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access] subscriber base has grown to approximately **5 million customers**, though the company recently implemented a **soft data cap on fixed wireless service**, adjusting its data prioritization strategy to manage network congestion[2]. This policy adjustment suggests T-Mobile is managing capacity constraints as its FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access] subscriber base matures.

### Verizon

Verizon's performance this week reflects mixed results across its business segments. The company has demonstrated strength in broadband gains and 5G growth, with stock performance up **9.6% year-to-date**[3]. However, the company continues to face challenges in fixed wireless access deployment relative to competitors' growth rates.

New CEO Dan Schulman has signaled plans for **significant strategic changes** to address areas where Verizon has stumbled, particularly in fixed wireless access and other business segments[2]. These planned changes suggest management recognition that current competitive positioning requires operational adjustments.

Verizon's strategic focus on **5G ultra-wideband deployment** and customer-focused service improvements represents the company's approach to maintaining competitive differentiation, though rising capital expenditure requirements and intense competitive pressure from AT&T and T
