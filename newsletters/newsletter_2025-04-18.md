## Key Industry Trends in U.S. Data Technology (Week of April 12–18, 2025)

- **Agentic AI^[Artificial Intelligence] adoption is accelerating** across major telecoms, with both AT&T and Verizon deploying hundreds of generative AI agents to automate workflows, enhance customer service, and optimize network operations[6](https://www.mobileworldlive.com/att/feature-operators-call-up-agentic-ai/).
- **Satellite-to-cellular connectivity is advancing**, as AT&T prepares to trial direct-to-cell satellite services for public safety on its FirstNet^[First Responder Network Authority] platform after receiving FCC approval this week[8](https://www.telecoms.com/satellite/fcc-green-light-opens-way-for-at-t-firstnet-direct-to-cell-trials)[10](https://www.labs.att.com/story/2025/firstnet-satellite-connectivity.html).
- **Mergers & acquisitions (M&A) speculation intensifies**, especially around Lumen’s consumer fiber business. Analysts see a potential $5.5 billion acquisition by AT&T as the most likely major deal in 2025—a move that could reshape competitive dynamics for T-Mobile Fiber and others[1](https://www.lightreading.com/fttx/losing-lumen-to-at-t-could-doom-t-mobile)[2](https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/next-big-telecom-ma-deal-horizon).
- **Spectrum strategy shifts**: T-Mobile is divesting its 800 MHz spectrum portfolio while acquiring new low-band assets to strengthen rural coverage and utility sector partnerships[5](https://tecknexus.com/t-mobile-sells-800-mhz-spectrum-to-grain-management/25/).

## Company-Specific News

### **AT&T**

- **Direct-to-cell Satellite Trials:** The FCC granted permission for AST SpaceMobile and AT&T to begin testing direct-to-cellular connectivity on Band 14 spectrum used by FirstNet. These trials will start later this year, aiming to extend public safety-grade broadband into remote areas where terrestrial coverage remains challenging. This initiative will complement existing SatCOLT deployments and further solidify FirstNet’s leadership in emergency communications infrastructure[8](https://www.telecoms.com/satellite/fcc-green-light-opens-way-for-at-t-firstnet-direct-to-cell-trials)[10](https://www.labs.att.com/story/2025/firstnet-satellite-connectivity.html).
  
- **Agentic AI Deployment:** AT&T now has over 410 generative agentic AI agents in production across its operations—automating complex tasks with human oversight via frameworks like Ask AT&T Workflows. These modular “agents” are being used internally for network management, customer service automation, data analysis (“Ask Data”), and more—improving accuracy while maintaining control over critical processes through checkpoints[6](https://www.mobileworldlive.com/att/feature-operators-call-up-agentic-ai/) .

### **T-Mobile**

- **Spectrum Portfolio Realignment:** T-Mobile announced the sale of its entire 800 MHz spectrum portfolio to Grain Management LLC in exchange for cash plus Grain’s holdings of valuable low-band (600 MHz) licenses. This transaction aims to enhance rural coverage capabilities—especially important as utilities seek robust wireless solutions—and is expected to close by end of April pending regulatory approvals[5](https://tecknexus.com/t-mobile-sells-800-mhz-spectrum-to-grain-management/25/) .
  
    - The deal also supports T-Mobile's ongoing leadership in nationwide ^[Fifth Generation] services.
  
    - Financial analysts project that T-Mobile Fiber could reach five million customers with $5 billion revenue potential by 2030 if it continues expanding aggressively into fixed broadband markets—a trajectory that may be affected if Lumen's fiber assets are acquired by a competitor like AT&T [1](https://www.lightreading.com/fttx/losing-lumen-to-at-t-could-doom-t-mobile).

### **Verizon**

- **AI-Powered Customer Service:** Verizon continues rolling out agentic AI tools using Google Cloud Gemini models within its customer support systems; these have reduced average call times significantly while achieving a reported accuracy rate of up to 96% in agent assistance scenarios.
  
    - Verizon develops some custom agents but primarily leverages vendor-provided solutions integrated into unified orchestration platforms for automation across their networks [6](https://www.mobileworldlive.com/att/feature-operators-call-up-agentic-ai/) .
  
    - Like peers, Verizon remains active at industry events focused on channel partner growth—including the Channel Partners Conference/MSP Summit where leaders discussed leveraging ^[Artificial Intelligence], cybersecurity advances, UCaaS^[Unified Communications as a Service], CCaaS^[Contact Center as a Service], cloud migration strategies, and next-gen connectivity [3](https://channel
