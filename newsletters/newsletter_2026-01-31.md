### Key Industry Trends in U.S. Data Technology (Week of Jan 27-31, 2026)

The U.S. telecommunications sector is witnessing accelerated **fiber network expansion** and **5G-wireless convergence** as carriers position for sustained growth amid saturated mobile markets and rising broadband demand from remote work, streaming, and IoT devices. Major players are leveraging multi-billion-dollar acquisitions to boost **FTTH^[Fiber to the Home]^** passings to over 30-40 million locations, enabling bundled services that reduce churn and lift ARPU^[Average Revenue Per User]^. Fixed wireless access (FWA) supplements fiber in rural areas, while cable incumbents face erosion from telco fiber overbuilds. Industry forecasts predict steady performance in 2026, with fiber markets growing at 12.4% CAGR through 2030, though M&A integration and debt levels pose risks.[1](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/at-t-bets-on-fiber-spectrum-deals-to-forecast-annual-profit-above-expectations-ce7e5bd9dc8eff22)[2](http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/chroniclejournal/article/marketminute-2026-1-30-at-and-t-signals-resilience-in-2025-earnings-betting-on-fiber-convergence-to-stabilize-2026-outlook)[3](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2818667/vz-wins-regulatory-nod-for-frontier-buyout-will-it-boost-prospects)[5](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/us-telecom-2026-outlook-performance-will-be-steady-with-ongoing-risks-from-ma-and-shareholder-returns-s101662999)

**Convergence strategies** dominate, with 42% of fiber households bundling 5G mobile services for loyalty gains, as telcos shift from device-driven growth to unified home-mobile utilities. AT&T and Verizon lead fiber builds, targeting 10-11 million new homes in 2026-2027, while T-Mobile leans on FWA amid capacity concerns. Cable providers invest heavily in fiber but lose ground to telco expansions.[2](http://markets.chroniclejournal.com/chroniclejournal/article/marketminute-2026-1-30-at-and-t-signals-resilience-in-2025-earnings-betting-on-fiber-convergence-to-stabilize-2026-outlook)[3](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2818667/vz-wins-regulatory-nod-for-frontier-buyout-will-it-boost-prospects)
