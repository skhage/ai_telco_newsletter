The last week underscored three intertwined U.S. data-tech themes: **fixed wireless access growth and policy pressure**, **fiber M&A and convergence plays**, and **cable’s scramble to defend broadband with DOCSIS and mobile bundles**.[1](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/)[2](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/)[7](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/cable-s-mobile-gains-could-grow-dramatically-in-2026) Against that backdrop, AT&T, T‑Mobile, Verizon, Lumen and Charter each advanced pieces of a broader shift toward converged fiber‑plus‑wireless broadband, with M&A and spectrum still central to strategy.[1](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/)[2](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/)[3](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/looking-ahead-m-a-watch-for-2026)

## Cross‑industry data technology trends

- **Convergence of mobile and broadband**  
  Operators are explicitly using fiber and home broadband expansion to deepen the mobile bundle and reduce churn, making “one pipe, many services” the organizing principle for strategy.[2](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/) AT&T’s planned purchase of Lumen’s mass‑market fiber and T‑Mobile’s fiber JVs with EQT and KKR are being framed as convergence accelerants rather than one‑off land grabs.[1](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/)[2](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/)

- **Fixed wireless access (FWA) as a mainstream access layer**  
  T‑Mobile remains the FWA leader, but Verizon has been narrowing the gap in net adds, and Verizon’s planned acquisition of FWA provider Starry shows incumbents are willing to buy, not just build, capacity in this segment.[1](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/)[2](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/) AT&T is leaning harder into “Internet Air” as its own FWA response in markets where fiber is thin.[1](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/)

- **Fiber M&A and open‑access builds**  
  Analysts expect *more* fiber‑focused M&A in 2026 as AT&T, Verizon, and T‑Mobile hunt for additional assets to support convergence, including potential stakes in open‑access networks.[3](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/looking-ahead-m-a-watch-for-2026) T‑Mobile’s work with Tillman FiberCo and its JVs around Lumos and Metronet highlight that national wireless brands are increasingly comfortable owning only part of the underlying plant.[1](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/)[2](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/)

- **Cable fights back with HFC and mobile**  
  Charter is putting real capital behind a next‑gen **HFC^[Hybrid Fiber‑Coax]** upgrade program while also riding rapid mobile‑line growth; analysts at MoffettNathanson see cable’s U.S. smartphone share rising “dramatically” in 2026 as bundles strengthen.[1](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/)[7](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/cable-s-mobile-gains-could-grow-dramatically-in-2026)

- **Policy and permitting headwinds**  
  As **BEAD^[Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment]** plans move from paper to builds, carriers are increasingly vocal about broadband permitting delays and cost inflation, particularly in fiber projects.[1](https://onetouchintelligence.com/insights/)

With that context, here’s how each of your five companies figured into this week’s data‑technology narrative.

## AT&T

**Key themes this week:** FWA expansion, mid‑band spectrum acceleration, and fiber reach via Lumen’s assets.

- **Internet Air FWA expansion**  
  AT&T is expanding its **Internet Air
