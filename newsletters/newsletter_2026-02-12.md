**Key data technology trends in US telecom this week** include accelerating **fiber buildouts** by major players like AT&T to hit multi-million location run-rates annually, persistent gaps in **STIR/SHAKEN^**^[STIR/SHAKEN: Secure Telephone Identity Revisited / Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs, a framework for authenticating caller ID information to combat robocalls.]** robocall mitigation between Tier-1 carriers and smaller operators, and ongoing **BEAD^**^[Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program: A federal initiative allocating $42.45 billion for broadband expansion in underserved areas.]** funding assurances amid network modernization pressures.[1][2][5]

### AT&T
AT&T is ramping up its **fiber** deployment pace significantly, planning to reach a run-rate of **4 million locations** in 2026 before expanding to **5 million locations annually** through the end of the decade, positioning it to close in on competitors like Lumen in fiber coverage.[2]  
Additionally, AT&T demonstrated strong robocall mitigation performance in the latest TNS 2026 Robocall Investigation Report, with **85% of traffic** between Tier-1 carriers (including AT&T) being signed and **93%** receiving the highest "A-level" attestation, far outpacing smaller carriers at just 17.5% signed traffic—highlighting AT&T's proactive IP network investments and STIR/SHAKEN implementation.[1]  
AT&T also entered a broader agreement with AWS, agreeing to provide **high-capacity fiber connectivity** to AWS points of presence, supporting cloud migration and satellite connectivity initiatives in data technology infrastructure.[3]

### T-Mobile
T-Mobile featured prominently in the TNS 2026 Robocall Report for its effective robocall defenses among Tier-1 carriers, contributing to the **85% signed call traffic** benchmark and **93% A-level attestation** rates, which underscore successful transitions from legacy switched networks to modern IP architectures that enhance call security and customer trust.[1]  
No other major data technology announcements specific to T-Mobile emerged this week, though broader industry convergence notes cable operators like Charter capturing **45% of new wireless customers** in 2025, intensifying postpaid competition pressures on wireless giants including T-Mobile.[4]

### Verizon
Verizon led Tier-1 robocall mitigation efforts per the TNS report, achieving the high **85% signed traffic** and **93% A-level** metrics through robust STIR/SHAKEN adoption and network modernization, setting it apart from smaller carriers struggling with legacy TDM^^[Time Division Multiplexing: A legacy telephony technology for circuit-switched voice networks.]** systems that enable robocall spoofing.[1]  
Verizon is also updating **5G gear** at MetLife Stadium ahead of the 2026 World Cup, bolstering data capacity for high-density events, while reports indicate it's in talks to acquire EchoStar’s **AWS-3 spectrum** assets to strengthen its wireless data portfolio.[3]

### Lumen
Lumen showed solid robocall mitigation results in the TNS 2026 Report as a Tier-1 carrier, aligning with the **85% signed traffic** group, though it faces competitive pressure from AT&T's aggressive fiber expansion aiming for **4-5 million locations** annually by decade's end, potentially encroaching on Lumen's footprint.[1][2]  
The report notes Lumen's progress in IP modernization helps counter vulnerabilities like decreased trust in A-level attestations due to spoofing tactics prevalent in less-advanced networks.[1]

### Charter Communications
Charter was highlighted in the TNS Robocall Report for maintaining Tier-1 standards with **85% signed call traffic** and **93% A-level** attestation, benefiting from investments beyond minimal compliance to deliver secure voice services amid rising robocall threats.[1]  
In wireless data trends, Charter (as part of cable operators) captured **45% of all new wireless customers** in 2025, fueling "the great convergence" where cable MSOs^^[Multiple System Operators: Cable companies operating multiple broadband and video networks.]** challenge traditional carriers on slim margins in the US postpaid market.[4]
