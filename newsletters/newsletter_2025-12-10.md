## Cross‑industry data trends shaping all five players

- **FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access] hits record quarterly net adds**  
  The third quarter of 2025 delivered **over 1 million net new FWA customers**, the biggest quarterly gain yet, with **AT&T, T‑Mobile, and Verizon driving most of the growth**.[3](https://potsandpansbyccg.com/category/the-industry/) Total FWA subs for the three reached about **14.3 million**.[3](https://potsandpansbyccg.com/category/the-industry/) This momentum is still the headline competitive story hanging over cable and legacy telco broadband.

- **Aggressive bundling to lock in broadband share**  
  - Wireless carriers are discounting FWA when bundled with mobile lines. T‑Mobile and Verizon cut FWA broadband prices by **about $15/month** when bundled with a cellphone plan, driving effective prices into the **$35–$45/month** range with autopay.[3](https://potsandpansbyccg.com/category/the-industry/)  
  - Cable operators like Charter are countering with mobile‑first bundles, including recent offers where homes that maintain **four mobile lines get “free” broadband** for as long as they keep those phone lines.[3](https://potsandpansbyccg.com/category/the-industry/)

- **Fiber build + M&A as the long‑term data backbone**
