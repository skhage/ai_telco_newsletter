### Key Industry Trends and News

#### Robocall Mitigation Efforts
**Top Carriers Enhance Robocall Mitigation Efforts**
- **Report Highlights**: The 2025 Robocall Investigation Report by Transaction Network Services (TNS) has highlighted the significant progress made by top US telecom providers in mitigating robocalls. The report notes that 86% of all traffic between top carriers (Verizon, UScellular, T-Mobile, Lumen, Comcast, Charter, and AT&T) was signed throughout the year, with 95% of call traffic signed with 'A-level' attestation [1][5].
- **Implementation Success**: The implementation of STIR/SHAKEN has enabled these carriers to establish SIP-to-SIP connections between originating and terminating parties, thereby preventing malicious robocall activities on tier-1 networks. However, the report also underscores that non-top carriers' networks remain at serious risk due to their reliance on legacy TDM circuits and the stripping of original STIR/SHAKEN data [1][5].

#### Satellite-Based Mobile Services
**T-Mobile Starlink Beta Now Open to All Carriers**
- **Service Expansion**: T-Mobile has officially opened its Starlink beta program to all carriers, including AT&T and Verizon customers. This service uses satellite technology to provide cell phone signals in areas where traditional cell towers cannot reach, aiming to eliminate mobile dead zones [2][4].
- **Pricing Model**: T-Mobile customers can access the service for free until its formal launch in July. After that, consumer and business customers on T-Mobile's Go5G Next tariff plans will continue to have access for free, while others will pay $15 per month. AT&T and Verizon customers will have to pay $20 per month [2][4].

#### Cybersecurity Concerns
**China-Backed Hackers Breach US Telecom Networks**
- **Cyberattack Details**: A recent cyberattack known as the Salt Typhoon has compromised several US telecom networks, including those of AT&T, Verizon, Lumen Technologies, Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications, and Windstream. The attack exploited unpatched network devices from Fortinet and Cisco to gain entry into these networks [3].
- **Impact Assessment**: The breach allowed hackers to redirect traffic back to China and delete their digital tracks. This incident aligns with previous warnings about Chinese-government-linked groups exploiting vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure networks [3].
