### AT&T

*No major new deal closed this week*, but AT&T remains in focus as it awaits regulatory approval for its planned $5.75 billion acquisition of Lumen’s fiber access assets—a move that would significantly expand its FTTH footprint in competition with both cable giants and other telcos[3](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-gets-its-m-a-wishes-after-ditching-dei-53423/) [4](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/another-wave-of-fiber-and-cable-m-a-could-be-heading--our-way). Analysts expect AT&T to continue seeking additional fiber assets as part of a broader industry push toward home broadband/mobile convergence.

### T-Mobile

T-Mobile had a pivotal week:

* The FCC approved T-Mobile’s $4.9 billion joint venture acquisition of Metronet (in partnership with KRR), giving it a 50% stake in a wholesale provider passing about 2 million homes across 17 states—with ambitions to reach 6.5 million by 2030[1](https://broadbandbreakfast.com/fcc-approves-t-mobile-metronet-deal/) [3](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-getss-it-s-ma-wishes-after--ditching--dei--53423).
* This follows April’s closure of the Lumos deal ($950 million investment), which will see Lumos become an open access provider anchored by T-Mobile; Lumos currently passes about 475,000 homes but aims for 3.5 million by end of 2028.
* These moves are part of CEO Mike Sievert's plan to reach up to *15 million fiber passings*, positioning T-Mobile as a serious player in bundled fixed/mobile broadband.
* Separately, after FCC approval for Metronet, the DOJ announced it will not oppose T-Mobile's planned $4.4 billion acquisition of most UScellular assets—a deal first announced in May that further strengthens its rural coverage ambitions[3](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-getss-it-s-ma-wishes-after--ditching--dei--53423).

### Verizon

Verizon also made headlines:

* Received regulatory green light for its $20 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications’ broadband service business—a significant expansion into wireline infrastructure aimed at supporting converged offerings alongside mobile services[3](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-getss-it-s-ma-wishes-after--ditching--dei--53423) [4](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/another-wave-of-fiber-and-cable-m-a-could-be-heading---our-way).
* Like rivals AT&T and T-Mobile, Verizon is expected to remain active in pursuing additional fiber targets such as Brightspeed or Altafiber according to industry analysts.

### Lumen

Lumen remains central due to ongoing M&A activity:

* Its pending sale (for $5.75 billion) of key fiber access assets to AT&T underscores how legacy network providers are divesting infrastructure while larger players consolidat
