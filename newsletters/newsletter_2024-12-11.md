### Data Technology Trends in the United States: Week of December 4-11, 2024

#### AT&T
- **Fiber Expansion and Customer Growth**: AT&T has made significant strides in its fiber expansion, adding 600,000 new fiber passings per quarter in 2024, up from 400-500,000 in 2023. This growth is expected to reach their 30 million target by the second quarter of 2025, six months ahead of their initial goal[1].
- **Customer Fiber Adoption**: The company has seen a notable increase in consumer fiber customers, reaching roughly 9 million at the end of the quarter. This growth is attributed to bundling discounts for existing wireless customers and a "complete move to AT&T" bundle for unsatisfied broadband customers[1].
- **Revenue and Margins**: AT&T has managed to maintain high average monthly fiber revenue per household at $70.36, with an estimated gross margin of 90% on each fiber connection due to lower maintenance costs on new plant installations[1].
- **Capital Priorities and Future Plans**: AT&T is focusing on densification processes to attract additional customers, which is cheaper and easier to implement than initial coverage construction. The company is also not distracted by merger approvals and is prioritizing wireless and broadband saturation in its footprint[1].

#### T-Mobile
- **No Major Announcements**: There were no significant announcements or updates from T-Mobile regarding its data technology initiatives this week.

#### Verizon
- **Administrative Fee Increase**: Verizon has confirmed an increase in its "Administrative and Telco Recovery Charge" by $0.20 per line starting December 18. This fee hike affects mobile voice and data-only products but does not impact Verizon Home Internet services[2].
- **5G Strategy Shift**: Verizon has shifted its focus for mid-band C-band 5G airwaves from coverage to customer satisfaction and revenue. The company is now installing C-band radios in areas where it can improve customer satisfaction scores while also collecting more revenue by offering additional services like fixed wireless[4].
- **5G Network Expansion**: Verizon continues to expand its 5G network, adding small cells that run C-band mid-band airwaves instead of mmWave. This strategy aims to provide better user experiences and support the company's long-term 5G goals[4].

#### Lumen
- **Cybersecurity Concerns**: Lumen, along with other major telecom companies like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, has been implicated in breaches attributed to Chinese cyber espionage. The company has stated that customer data remained unaffected in these incidents[5].

#### Charter Communications

### Industry-Wide Trends

Industry representatives, including Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan, are slated to testify[5].
- **Network Security Priorities**: Incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr has vowed to prioritize network security in the coming months, emphasizing collaboration with national security agencies to tackle the threat posed by Chinese cyber espionage[5].
