### Week in Review: Data Technology Trends in the United States

#### AT&T
- **Price Increase for FirstNet Customers**: AT&T has announced a price increase for its FirstNet customers, with monthly rates rising by $3 per line starting January 15, 2025. This change affects unlimited smartphone and data-only plans, with the new rate being $48 per month. Customers who activated their service after April 15, 2024, will continue to pay the older rate until they complete nine months of service, during which time they will receive a $3 monthly credit to offset the increase [2][4].
- **FCC Approval for Wireless Local Phone Service**: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved AT&T's plan to replace traditional copper line local phone service with AT&T Phone Advanced, a wireless local phone alternative. This ruling sets a precedent for the acceleration of copper retirement, benefiting both AT&T and Verizon [3].

#### T-Mobile

- **FCC Merger Approval**: T-Mobile and EQT are seeking FCC approval for their merger, planning to run the network on an open access basis with T-Mobile as an early tenant. This move aims to increase competition and accessibility in the broadband market [1].

#### Verizon
- **Tower Deal with Vertical Bridge**: Verizon has finalized a $3.3 billion deal with Vertical Bridge, granting exclusive rights to lease, operate, and manage over 6,300 Verizon wireless communications towers across all 50 states. This deal underscores Verizon's commitment to expanding its network infrastructure [5].
- **Fiber Expansion and Regulatory Approvals**: Verizon is continuing its fiber expansion efforts, with recent regulatory approvals allowing it to absorb Frontier's 2.2 million fiber subscribers and 7.2 million passings in a $20 billion deal. The company is also exploring lead-clad cable concerns and advancing its fixed wireless and fiber growth [1][3].

#### Lumen
- **Altice Acquisition and Strategic Shifts**: Lumen, formerly part of Altice, is positioning itself to compete against new broadband competitors using mobile technologies. The company's strategy includes bundling broadband, video, and mobile services to counter emerging FTTH providers and traditional cable companies [3].

#### Charter Communications
