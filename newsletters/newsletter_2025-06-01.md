## AT&T

**Major Acquisition:**
- AT&T announced a $5.75 billion all-cash deal to acquire Lumen Technologies’ consumer FTTP unit^[Fiber to the Premises], marking one of its largest recent investments in fiber infrastructure[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/at-t-splashes-5-75bn-on-lumen-s-consumer-fttp-unit-53069/)[3](https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/fierce-networks-2025-telecom-and-tech-ma-tracker)[4](https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/25/05/45593861/deal-dispatch-onlyfans-to-sell-for-8-billion-telecom-ma-heats-up-wolfspeed-on-road-to-bankruptcy). This move reinforces AT&T’s strategy of unifying its wireless and fiber offerings as it seeks nationwide scale in high-speed broadband.

**Spectrum Strategy:**
- AT&T is actively involved in spectrum swaps with T-Mobile across hundreds of locations nationwide, optimizing holdings across PCS^[Personal Communications Service], AWS^[Advanced Wireless Services], and 700 MHz bands[5](https://www2.hl.com/pdf/2025/digital-infrastrcuture-market-update-q1-2025.pdf).
  
**Policy Advocacy:**
> “AT&T has proposed consolidating the 3.45 GHz band and C-band by relocating CBRS users... Operators benefit from contiguous spectrum allocations... lower-cost radios, reduced power consumption, higher efficiency...”  
— [Viewpoints: CBRS Showdown][2](https://bbcmag.com/viewpoints-cbrs-showdown-balancing-access-and-efficiency/)
  
AT&T continues lobbying for more contiguous mid-band spectrum allocations—critical for efficient deployment of next-gen (6G) networks.

## T-Mobile

**Spectrum Swaps & Network Optimization:**
- T-Mobile executed significant spectrum exchanges with both Verizon (in Kentucky) and AT&T (nationwide), targeting improved alignment between coverage needs and available frequencies[5](https://www2.hl.com/pdf/2025/digital-infrastrcuture-market-update-q1-2025.pdf).
    - Bands involved include PCS, AWS, 700 MHz (with AT&T), plus AWS, PCS, 600 MHz & 2.5 GHz (with Verizon).
    - These swaps help T-Mobile enhance data speeds while expanding its national 5G footprint.

**Regulatory Outlook:**
> “While some deals place T-Mobile over the FCC’s spectrum screen in key markets, approvals are generally expected given the current regulatory backdrop.”  
— [Digital Infrastructure Market Update][5](https://www2.hl.com/pdf/2025/digital-infrastrcuture-market-update-q1-2025.pdf)

T-Mobile remains well-positioned as regulators appear supportive amid broader industry consolidation.

## Verizon

**Strategic Spectrum Realignment:**
- Verizon participated in reciprocal spectrum swaps with T-Mobile focused on Kentucky markets; these moves aim at optimizing network performance through better-aligned frequency holdings[4](https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/25/05/45593861/deal-dispatch-onlyfans-to-sell-for-8-billion-telecom-ma-heats-up-wolfspeed-on-road-to-bankruptcy)[5](https://www2.hl.com/pdf/2025/digital-infrastrcuture-market-update-q1–2020.pdf).

**Major Acquisition Approval:**
> “The FCC approved Verizon’s $20 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications.”  
— [Deal Dispatch][4](https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/25/05/45593861/deal-dispatch-onlyfans-to-sell-for–8-billion–telecom-ma-heats-up-wolfspeed-on-road-to-bankruptcy)

This acquisition further cements Verizon's position as a dominant player by expanding its wireline broadband reach into new territories formerly served by Frontier Communications.
