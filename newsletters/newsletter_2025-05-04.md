## AT&T

**Rumored Lumen Acquisition**
- AT&T is at the center of industry rumors regarding a potential $5.5 billion acquisition bid for Lumen Technologies this week. Such a move would significantly expand AT&T’s fiber footprint and enterprise service capabilities^[1](https://www.lightreading.com/finance/finding-the-upside-to-a-shrinking-wireless-marketplace).

**Customer Growth**
- Analysts project that AT&T will add approximately 254,000 postpaid phone customers in Q1 2025—a solid performance given the overall market contraction^[1](https://www.lightreading.com/finance/finding-the-upside-to-a-shrinking-wireless-marketplace).

## T-Mobile

**US Cellular Acquisition Progress**
- T-Mobile’s acquisition of UScellular has nearly completed regulatory review (178 out of the required 180 days), with expectations that final approval will come in May. This deal could further consolidate T-Mobile’s position in rural markets and enhance its spectrum holdings^[4](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations/).

**Fiber M&A Strategy**
- CEO Mike Sievert reiterated T-Mobile's preference for acquiring "pureplay" fiber providers to accelerate broadband expansion rather than pursuing companies with mixed business models or legacy assets. Hotwire Communications was mentioned as an example but may not be an ideal fit; other targets like Metronet or Lumos could be more compatible with T-Mobile's strategy^[2](https://www.lightreading.com/fttx/t-mobile-ceo-prefers-pureplay-fiber-for-m-a)[4](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations/).

**Network Slicing Leadership**
- T-Mobile continues to lead on deploying standalone (SA) 5G-powered network slicing solutions—enabling differentiated services for public safety agencies and enterprises—while Verizon follows suit; AT&T appears less aggressive on this front currently^[3](https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless).

**Subscriber Growth**
- Expected to add about 500,000 postpaid phone subscribers in Q1, maintaining its growth trajectory despite broader market headwinds^[2](https://www.lightreading.com/fttx/t-mobile-ceo-prefers-pureplay-fiber-for-m-a)[4](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations/).

## Verizon

**Postpaid Subscriber Losses & Strategic Focus**
- Verizon is projected to lose roughly 308,000 postpaid consumer phone subscribers in Q1—a continuation of recent trends amid fierce competition from rivals like T-Mobile[^2][^3]. However, analysts highlight Verizon’s strong wireless service revenue growth outlook and ongoing investments in fiber infrastructure as positives.
