## AT&T

- **Dominates Carrier Ethernet**: Maintains the top spot in U.S. Carrier Ethernet thanks to sustained investment in fiber networks and next-gen service deployment.
  
    - CFO Pascal Desroches confirmed that cost savings will be reinvested into expanding fiber-based offerings, aiming for future growth in both fiber broadband and advanced connectivity revenues[1](https://www.lightwaveonline.com/home/article/55313518/att-remains-the-dominant-ethernet-provider).

    - Despite secular declines in legacy TDM^[Time Division Multiplexing]-based services, AT&T's Consumer Wireline business grew by 5.8% YoY^[Year-over-Year], driven by strong momentum in its fiber broadband segment.

    - Net additions this quarter: 
        - Fiber: +243,000
        - Internet Air (fixed wireless): +203,000

    - Nationwide reach now covers 30 million consumer/business locations; acquisition of Lumen’s consumer fiber assets adds another million customers across 11 states[3](https://www.ainvest.com/news/reaffirms-fiscal-2025-guidance-confirms-capital-return-plans-2509/) .

    - Mobility segment also up (+6.7% YoY), reflecting robust subscriber growth.

## T-Mobile

*No major standalone announcements surfaced this week*, but:

   - Remains the fastest-growing U.S. telecom by net customer additions—adding approximately 1.7 million postpaid net customers last quarter.
   - Recently entered a partnership with Charter Communications aimed at bundling mobile products with wireline offerings for business clients—a move expected to deepen its presence among enterprise customers via cross-selling opportunities[1](https://www.lightwaveonline.com/home/article/55313518/att-remains-the-dominant-ethernet-provider).

## Verizon

   - Focuses on strengthening managed services through new partnerships (notably HCLTech) as part of an effort to improve EBITDA margins.
   - Consumer revenues rose nearly 7% YoY last quarter due to gains across both service plans and equipment sales.
   - Continues facing pressure from legacy VPN/Ethernet revenue declines but offsets some losses through managed/cloud service expansion targeting large enterprises[1](https://www.lightwaveonline.com/home/article/55313518/att-remains-the-dominant-ethernet-provider).

## Lumen Technologies

   - Sharply pivots toward enterprise markets after selling its consumer fiber assets (now owned by AT&T). This $5.74B deal allows Lumen to focus on “AI-ready” network solutions such as Private Connectivity Fabric (PCF)—custom architectures designed specifically for artificial intelligence workloads.
   
   - Revenue challenges persist:
       * Q2 Business segment revenue fell ~3.4%, mainly due to continued decline in VPN/Ethernet demand.
       * Leadership remains optimistic that focusing on core enterprise capabilities will stabilize performance long-term while improving balance sheet health via asset divestitures.[1](https://www.lightwaveonline.com/home/article/55313518/att-remains-the-dominant-ethernet-provider)
