## Company-Specific Updates

### **AT&T**
- AT&T continues its large-scale deployment of Open RAN technology across the U.S., aiming for full coverage by next year. The company is integrating cloud RAN solutions with Ericsson and third-party radios from Fujitsu and Mavenir to modernize its network while improving efficiency through unified management systems[2](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250310/carriers/att-at-mwc-open-ran-ai)[4](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/att-lauds-open-ran-progress-eyes-further-small-cell-opportunities/).
- FirstNet, AT&T's dedicated public safety network, now serves over 7 million connections with expanded coverage of nearly 3 million square miles. New tools like enhanced Network Status Maps provide first responders with unprecedented visibility into network health[10](https://about.att.com/story/2025/firstnet-expands-coverage.html).
- The company is also preparing for its Q1 earnings release on April 23[6](https://about.att.com/story/2025/1q-reminder.html).

### **T-Mobile**
- T-Mobile has been upgrading its fixed wireless access (FWA) speeds alongside Verizon over the past year as part of efforts to enhance broadband services[7](https://www.lightreading.com/fixed-wireless-access/verizon-and-t-mobile-fwa-speeds-are-actually-increasing).
- Analysts remain bullish on T-Mobile’s stock performance; Barclays recently reaffirmed a "Buy" rating with a price target of $250 per share due to strong market positioning[5](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/t-mobile-us-tmus-gets-a-buy-from-barclays-1034536759).
- The company is expected to innovate further by bundling fiber offerings from Metronet and Lumos once joint ventures are finalized later this year. This could include unique perks such as speed upgrades for bundled customers or free streaming services[1](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-wireless-competitive-dynamics).

### **Verizon**
- Verizon has seen improvements in FWA speeds alongside T-Mobile but faces challenges related to customer retention during device upgrade cycles. Many customers are delaying upgrades after completing payment plans, creating opportunities for competitors like AT&T and T-Mobile to attract switchers[7](https://www.lightreading.com/fixed-wireless-access/verizon-and-t-mobile-fwa-speeds-are-actually-increasing)[1](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-wireless-competitive-dynamics).
  
### **Lumen Technologies**
While no major announcements specific to Lumen were made this week, it participated prominently at the Channel Partners Conference/MSP Summit held March 24–27 in Las Vegas. Discussions focused on AI integration within cybersecurity solutions—a key area shaping future channel strategies across industries[9](https://channelpartnersconference.com/news/channel-partners-conferencemsp-summit).

### **Charter Communications**
Charter received an "A" grade in a recent report evaluating telecom companies' efforts against robocalls—one of only three companies achieving this distinction. This reflects Charter's commitment to consumer protection amid growing concerns about unwanted calls nationwide[3](https://www.abc15.com/news/let-abc15).
