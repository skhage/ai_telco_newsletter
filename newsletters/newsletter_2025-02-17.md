### Key Industry Trends and News for the Week

#### 1. **FCC Orders Telecoms to Secure Networks**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued a declaratory ruling requiring U.S. telecommunications carriers to secure their networks following the Salt Typhoon security breaches. This action comes after FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel emphasized the need for urgent measures to protect against cyberattacks, citing vulnerabilities exposed by the Salt Typhoon hacking group [1].

- **Action Taken:** The FCC has adopted a declaratory ruling that takes effect immediately, mandating telecom companies to secure their networks from communications interception and unlawful access under section 105 of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA).
- **Additional Measures:** The FCC also seeks to strengthen communications against future cyberattacks by requiring telecoms to submit annual certifications confirming they have an up-to-date cybersecurity risk management plan. The Commission is seeking comment on other ways to enhance the cybersecurity of communications systems and services.

#### 2. **T-Mobile Expands Starlink Trial**
T-Mobile has expanded its free Starlink trial to include customers from AT&T and Verizon. This move allows a broader audience to test the satellite-based service, which aims to eliminate mobile dead zones in remote areas of the U.S. using SpaceX’s low Earth orbit (LEO) Starlink satellites [2][4].

- **Service Details:** The service is currently limited to text messaging but will add voice and data services in the future. The public beta phase is now open, offering the service free until its commercial launch in July. After that, users will have the option to access Starlink’s direct-to-device services for an additional fee ($15 per month for T-Mobile customers and $20 per month for AT&T/Verizon customers).

#### 3. **Robocall Mitigation Efforts**
Top U.S. telecom providers, including AT&T, Charter, Comcast, Lumen, T-Mobile, UScellular, and Verizon, continue to make progress in maximizing the benefits of STIR/SHAKEN implementation to mitigate unwanted robocalls [3][5].

- **Report Highlights:** The 2025 Robocall Investigation Report by Transaction Network Services (TNS) shows that 86% of all traffic between these tier-1 carriers was signed throughout the year. Additionally, 95% of call traffic between these carriers was signed with 'A-level' attestation, which helps prevent malicious robocall activities on tier-1 networks.
- **Challenges:** Despite the positive momentum among top carriers, non-top carriers face significant challenges in implementing similar systems. The report notes that non-top carriers' networks remain at serious risk due to their reliance on legacy TDM circuits and the dropping of original STIR/SHAKEN information.
