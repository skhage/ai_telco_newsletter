## AT&T

**Convergence Focus & Fiber Expansion**
- AT&T remains committed to a *fiber-first* approach, positioning wireless as the "icing" on its converged service strategy. The company is aggressively retiring legacy copper networks—filing with the FCC to discontinue service across 10% of wire centers in 17 states—with plans to exit most copper by end of 2029 (except California)[3](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/wireless-the-icing-on-at-t-s-convergence-service-strategy-ceo-says).

**Fixed Wireless Access Growth**
- The *Internet Air* FWA product surpassed one million subscribers after adding over 200,000 in Q2. This offering targets areas not yet reached by fiber and cost-conscious consumers[3](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/wireless-the-icing-on-at-t-s-convergence-service-strategy-ceo-says).

**Lumen Asset Integration**
- Recently acquired Lumen assets will be moved into a new "NetworkCo" joint venture focused on open access wholesale platforms; AT&T will serve as anchor tenant. Analysts are watching whether this JV or Gigapower will drive future builds in Lumen markets[3](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/wireless-the-icing-on-at-t-s-convergence-service-strategy-ceo-says).

## T-Mobile

**Major Enterprise MVNO Deals**
- T-Mobile signed exclusive MVNO agreements with both Charter Communications and Comcast for enterprise-focused nationwide 5G connectivity.

    - The deals are strictly for business customers; existing consumer MVNO partnerships remain unchanged.
    - Both cable companies plan continued development of proprietary solutions using Wi-Fi, CBRS^[Citizens Broadband Radio Service], and multiple cellular networks.

**Strategic Impact**
  
   - This move strengthens T-Mobile’s position as a wholesale provider while increasing competitive pressure on Verizon within the enterprise segment.
   - Financial terms were not disclosed.

## Verizon

**MVNO Competition Intensifies**
  
   - While Verizon continues supplying network access for consumer mobile offerings at both Charter (Spectrum Mobile) and Comcast (Xfinity Mobile), it now faces direct B2B competition from those same partners via their new alliances with T-Mobile[1](https://www.mobileworldlive.com/t-mobile-us/comcast-charter-tap-t-mobile-us-for-business-5g/)[2](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/digital-platforms-services/what-s-up-with-nokia-at-t-comcast-charter-t-mobile-us-53498/) .
