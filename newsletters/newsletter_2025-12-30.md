### Key Industry Trends in US Data Technology (Week of Dec 23-29, 2025)

The US telecommunications sector closed 2025 with accelerated **consolidation** via mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures aimed at expanding **fiber-to-the-home (FTTH)^[Fiber to the Home]** networks and enhancing broadband capabilities, alongside rising focus on **fixed wireless access (FWA)^[Fixed Wireless Access]** subscriber growth and energy-efficient infrastructure for AI-driven data demands^[1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/) [7](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/looking-ahead-m-a-watch-for-2026). **Direct-to-device (D2D)^[Direct-to-Device]** satellite connectivity matured into commercial services, boosting mobile data coverage, while robocall mitigation scrutiny intensified on major providers handling high-volume traffic^[4](https://www.lightreading.com/satellite/2025-in-review-d2d-rolls-out) [3](https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/News-Room/Current-News/Robocall%20Ph2%20letters.pdf?language_id=1). Forecasts predict continued FWA adds (3.6 million in 2026, split across carriers) and cable broadband declines offset by total broadband gains, with power management emerging as a key constraint for data-heavy networks^[6](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/04/new-street-research-study-cable-broadband-will-continue-its-decline-but-total-broadband-access-subscribers-will-increase/) [1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/).

### AT&T
AT&T's acquisition of **Lumen**'s consumer fiber business—covering nearly 1 million subscribers and 4 million passings—was highlighted in year-end reviews as a pivotal 2025 deal, with finalization expected in 2026 to bolster its **FTTH** footprint and convergence strategy^[1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/) [2](https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/fierce-networks-2025-telecom-and-tech-ma-tracker/). Ongoing expansion of its open-access joint venture with BlackRock (Gigapower) advanced **horizontal separation** trends, separating infrastructure assets to focus on service innovation, while committing $14 billion to energy-efficient network upgrades amid AI workload pressures^[1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/). Analysts position AT&T to potentially overtake T-Mobile as the world's most valuable telecom, driven by fiber scaling and strategic positioning^[5](https://sundaybrief.com/atts-simple-formula/). New Street Research forecasts 900,000 **FWA** subscriber adds in 2026, contributing to broadband growth despite cable declines^[6](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/04/new-street-research-study-cable-broadband-will-continue-its-decline-but-total-broadband-access-subscribers-will-increase/).

### T-Mobile
T-Mobile's fiber expansion via joint ventures gained traction, including its officially closed JV with EQT for **Lumos** (targeting 12-15 million homes passed by 2030) and a lower-profile acquisition of Minnesota ISP **U.S. Internet**, adding to its fiber toolkit alongside **Metronet**^[2](https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/fierce-networks-2025-telecom-and-tech-ma-tracker/). It trialed open-access fiber partnerships in select markets and partnered with **Metronet/Lumos** for network reach without full buys, aligning with industry **JV** trends^[1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/). Commercial **D2D** satellite service launched as the first in the US, leveraging FCC-approved SpaceX collaboration for mobile-band spectrum reuse and supplemental coverage^[4](https://www.lightreading.com/satellite/2025-in-review-d2d-rolls-out) [1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/). **FWA** projections show 1.7 million adds in 2026, with MoffettNathanson noting it drives over half of T-Mobile's network traffic^[6](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/04/new-street-research-study-cable-broadband-will-continue-its-decline-but-total-broadband-access-subscribers-will-increase/) [8](https://broadbandbreakfast.com/chart-of-fixed-wireless-access-subscribers/).
