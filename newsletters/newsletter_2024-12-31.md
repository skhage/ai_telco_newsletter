### Week in Review: Data Technology Trends in the United States

#### **Bandwidth Infrastructure Hype and Market Capitalization**

- **AT&T and T-Mobile Market Performance**: AT&T and T-Mobile have significantly outperformed the market in 2024, with T-Mobile experiencing a 45% increase in market capitalization and AT&T at 41%. This surge has positioned T-Mobile as the most valuable wireless service company, surpassing the combined value of Comcast and Charter Communications [1].
  
- **US Cellular Retail Operations Acquisition**: T-Mobile's acquisition of US Cellular retail operations, when approved, is expected to be an easy integration for the company's technology and operations teams. This move is anticipated to yield significant value from consumer postpaid phone net additions without the copper hangover [1].

#### **Competition and Subscriber Trends**

- **Comcast’s Cable CEO Dave Watson**: In a recent exchange with UBS analyst John Hodulik, Comcast’s Cable CEO Dave Watson highlighted the competitive intensity in the fourth quarter. He noted that Q4 resembles more of the first half of the year, with a slight impact from two hurricanes leading to around 10,000 broadband losses and a potential ARPU decrease [1].

- **AT&T’s Fiber Expansion**: AT&T announced an expansion of its local exchange fiber footprint by 15 million homes. The company also reiterated its plan to repurchase shares once it meets its 2.5x EBITDA/Net Debt leverage ratio. Additionally, AT&T emphasized its methodical approach to increasing the value of its fiber-built territories and detailed how custom/hybrid large language models are being used to improve operations and marketing [1].

#### **Cybersecurity Concerns**

- **Salt Typhoon Hacking Campaign**: The hacking of US telecom infrastructure by the Chinese group Salt Typhoon has been a major concern. AT&T and Verizon have issued official statements addressing the breach, assuring customers that their networks have been secured. The hacking targeted a small number of high-profile customers in government, and both carriers have taken significant steps to protect their networks, including partnering with federal law enforcement and national security agencies [2][4].

- **Scope of Breach**: The US government has confirmed that at least nine telecommunications providers have been targeted, including Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) and T-Mobile. The breach involved an administrator account with access to over 100,000 routers, highlighting the extensive nature of the attack [4].

#### **Regulatory Updates**

- **FCC Approval for AT&T’s Wireless Local Phone Service**: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved AT&T’s plan to replace traditional copper line local phone service with AT&T Phone Advanced, a wireless local phone alternative. This ruling sets a precedent for the acceleration of copper retirement, benefiting both AT&T and Verizon’s telco units [3].

#### **CES Preview – AI in Consumer Electronics**

- **AI Impact on Consumer Electronics**: The upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) will feature discussions on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is influencing the industry. While AI is expected to play a significant role, it is not anticipated to remake the consumer electronics industry overnight. Instead, it will likely enhance existing products and services [3].

#### **Altice’s Strategy**

- **Altice’s Competitive Strategy**: Altice is exploring ways to compete against new broadband competitors using mobile and video services. The company believes bundling broadband, video, and mobile could be an effective strategy against competitors like Frontier and upstart FTTH providers. However, the incorporation of video as a critical bundle component remains a challenge due to the dominance of digital aggregators like Amazon, Netflix, and Apple [3].
