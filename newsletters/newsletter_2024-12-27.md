### Week in Review: Data Technology News in the United States

#### **Security Threats and Cybersecurity Measures**

- **Chinese Surveillance Threats**: The U.S. security landscape has been heightened with the emergence of Chinese 'Salt Typhoon' hackers. The FBI and CISA have issued a joint statement warning that PRC-affiliated actors have compromised networks at multiple telecommunications companies, including Verizon, AT&T, and Lumen Technologies. These compromises enable the theft of customer call records data and the compromise of private communications of individuals involved in government or political activities[1]. The full scope of these attacks remains unclear, emphasizing the need for immediate precautions.

#### **Convergence in Telecommunications**

- **AT&T and Verizon's Convergence Strategy**: The convergence between wireless and wireline services has become a significant topic in 2024. AT&T and Verizon are actively bundling more fiber-based internet services with mobile offerings. This strategy aims to reduce postpaid phone churn by up to 50% when bundled with fiber, according to Verizon[2]. AT&T also claims benefits in fiber markets, noting a 25 basis points lower postpaid phone churn in these areas.

- **T-Mobile's Stance on Convergence**: T-Mobile, despite its strong market performance and record-breaking market cap of over $284 billion, remains skeptical about the importance of convergence. The company believes that bundling benefits exist but are not as significant as other factors like tablet bundling. T-Mobile has rolled out new FWA plans priced as low as $35/month, which are $15 cheaper for customers with mobile service, aiming to shift the mix to bundled customers[2].

#### **Open RAN Developments**

- **AT&T's Open RAN Transition**: AT&T has been at the forefront of open RAN adoption, awarding Ericsson a $14 billion contract to supply its open RAN network. By the end of 2024, AT&T added more radio vendors to its repertoire, including Fujitsu and Mavenir. The company is scaling its transition using a "popcorn approach," swapping out gear site by site in multiple geographies[4].

- **Verizon's Open RAN Commitment**: Verizon has signaled its intent to pursue open RAN technology by appointing Santiago "Yago" Tenorio as its new CTO and SVP of strategy and technology enablement. Tenorio was previously an open RAN guru at Vodafone, which plans to deploy open RAN on 30% of its European sites by 2030[4].

- **T-Mobile's Alternative Approach**: T-Mobile is not adopting open RAN but instead plans to supercharge its RAN with Nvidia. The company is working with Nvidia, Ericsson, and Nokia in a lab setting to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance the RAN's performance and profitability[4].

#### **Other Developments**

- **Boost Mobile's Open RAN Adoption**: Boost Mobile, formerly Dish Network, was the first U.S. operator to launch a network based on open RAN. Despite financial uncertainties, Boost Mobile continued to advocate for open RAN, highlighting its flexibility in switching vendors without causing major disruptions. The operator replaced VMware with Wind River[4].

### Summary

This week's news highlights significant developments in the U.S. data technology landscape:

- **Security Threats**: The ongoing surveillance threat from Chinese hackers underscores the need for immediate cybersecurity measures across U.S. telecommunications companies.
- **Convergence Strategy**: AT&T and Verizon are aggressively pursuing convergence by bundling fiber-based internet services with mobile offerings, aiming to reduce churn and enhance customer loyalty.
- **Open RAN Adoption**: AT&T remains a leader in open RAN adoption, while Verizon is committed to the technology. T-Mobile, however, is focusing on AI-enhanced traditional RAN.
- **Market Performance**: T-Mobile's strong market performance and record-breaking market cap are overshadowed by its limited growth and diversification compared to AT&T's fiber network strategy[3].

These trends reflect the evolving landscape of U.S. data technology, with a focus on security, convergence, and innovative network architectures.
