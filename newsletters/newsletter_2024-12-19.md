### Recent News and Announcements in Data Technology

#### **Wireline Broadband Retention Trends**
- **Study by New Street Research**: Despite concerns over widespread disconnections following the expiration of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), a new study reveals that more than 90% of participants who subscribed to wireline broadband have remained connected. This translates to roughly 10 million cable and fiber-optic customers maintaining service, with total disconnections projected to affect only 7.2% of these subscribers by the end of the year[1].
- **Company-Specific Data**:
  - **Charter Communications**: Projected a total decline of 355,000 ACP-supported subscribers, with 50,000 disconnections recorded in Q2 2024 and an additional 180,000 losses occurring during Q3. An additional 125,000 losses are anticipated by the end of Q4[1].
  - **Comcast**: Expects a total loss of 96,000 ACP subscribers by year-end from its 1.3 million total ACP customer base[1].
  - **AT&T**: Projected a total loss of 85,000 of its 1.1 million ACP subscribers, including 6,000 lost in Q2; 32,000 during Q3; and 47,000 anticipated in Q4[1].
  - **Cox Communications**: Expected to lose 52,000 of its 737,000 ACP participants, mostly distributed over the latter half of 2024[1].

#### **Wireless and Satellite Broadband Developments**
- **T-Mobile and Starlink Partnership**:
  - T-Mobile is now accepting applications to allow a limited number of customers to test its satellite-powered messaging before it rolls out for all customers. The service uses SpaceX's Starlink satellites to provide connections to dead zones. However, not all modern phones are compatible with the service at this time, and T-Mobile plans to expand the beta in the future as more satellites are launched[2].
  
#### **Fiber Broadband Mergers and Acquisitions**
- **Verizon's Acquisition of Frontier Communications**:
  - Verizon is buying Frontier Communications for $20 billion in cash. The acquisition will combine Verizon’s 7.4 million Fios subscribers with Frontier’s 2.2 million fiber subscribers, with very little overlap between the two footprints across 31 states[4].
- **Bell Canada's Acquisition of Ziply Fiber**:
  - Bell Canada is acquiring Ziply Fiber for about $5.1 billion (CAN $7 billion). This deal would make Bell Canada the third-largest fiber internet services provider in North America, after AT&T and Verizon[4].
- **T-Mobile's Joint Ventures**:
  - T-Mobile is forming joint ventures with investment firms KKR and EQT to acquire fiber providers Metronet and Lumos, respectively. T-Mobile will invest $4.9 billion in the Metronet joint venture and $950 million in the Lumos joint venture[4].

#### **Cybersecurity Concerns**
- **US Legislation to Contain Chinese Cyber Espionage**:
  - US senators were briefed on the alleged Chinese cyber-espionage campaign targeting the nation’s telecommunications networks. Companies like Verizon, AT&T, Lumen, and T-Mobile have been implicated in breaches, with Verizon confirming it was accessed by hackers who targeted key individuals in politics and government[5].
  - Incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr vowed to prioritize network security, emphasizing collaboration with national security agencies to tackle the threat[5].

These developments highlight the ongoing evolution in data technology within the United States, particularly focusing on broadband retention trends, wireless and satellite innovations, fiber broadband M&A activity, and cybersecurity concerns.
