- **Capex^[Capital Expenditure] Decline Across Major Telcos:** US telecom operators—including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile^[Deutsche Telekom], Lumen, and Charter—are reducing capital expenditures amid economic headwinds.

## Company-Specific News

### **AT&T**

* AT&T continues to face capex constraints but remains active in strategic acquisitions. A major development this week is the ongoing integration of Lumen's consumer fiber assets into AT&T's portfolio—a move expected to strengthen its FTTH^[Fiber to the Home] footprint and enhance competitive positioning against cable rivals[3](https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2025/06/usa/fixed-broadband-experience-msaview).
* The company’s focus remains on optimizing existing infrastructure while seeking efficiency gains through automation and AI-driven operations[1](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release /2025 /06 /10 /3096362 /28124 /en /US -Telecoms -Face -Capex -Decline -Amid -Economic -Challenges -A Review-of-Key Operators-Including ATT Verizon Charter Comcast T Mobile DT Lumen Frontier-and-More .html).

### **T-Mobile**

* T-Mobile saw significant fluctuations in market value this month but rebounded strongly over the past week as investor sentiment improved following positive news about its fixed wireless access (FWA) offerings[4](https://sundaybrief.com/valuecreation-long-term-charts-fab-five-vs-telco-top-five-june27).
* Performance improvements: T-Mobile’s 5G Home Internet has posted download speed increases of at least 20Mbps—and up to 54Mbps—in all top 20 metropolitan areas compared to last year. This positions FWA as a viable alternative where fiber or high-speed cable are unavailable, often outperforming legacy DSL services[3](https://www.opensignal.com/reports /2025 /06 /usa/fixed-broadband-experience-msaview).

### **Verizon**

* Like peers, Verizon is tightening capex budgets while focusing on maximizing returns from existing networks.
* The company continues investing selectively in network upgrades—particularly around automation—to maintain service quality without overspending amid economic uncertainty[1](https://www.globenewswire .com/newsrelease //20250605145415/en/U S Telco Capex Fading as AI Giants Take Center Stage New Report Focuses on Key Operators including ATT Verizon Charter Comcast TM obile DT L umen Frontierandmore ResearchAndMarkets com)[2].
  
### **Lumen Technologies**

* Lumen stands out for doubling down on serving enterprise customers powering the “AI economy.” Its digital platform leverages advanced automation for real-time network control.
* With consumer-facing assets being acquired by AT&T, Lumen will further concentrate resources on backbone infrastructure supporting cloud providers and large-scale data applications—a pivot that aligns with broader industry trends toward B2B services supporting hyperscalers^["Hyperscaler" refers to companies operating massive-scale data centers such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud]
