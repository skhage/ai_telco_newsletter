### Key Data Technology Trends in US Telecom (Week of December 16-22, 2025)

**Consolidation and infrastructure deals** dominated the week's narrative, with ongoing M&A activity signaling aggressive network expansion via fiber and spectrum assets, amid power constraints from AI-driven demand and cybersecurity threats exposing core systems.[1][2][3] **Fiber shakeout and open-access models** intensified, as operators pursued joint ventures and sales to scale **FTTH^[Fiber to the Home]^ deployments against fixed-wireless competition, while **mid-band spectrum deployments** and **FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access]^ capacity strains** highlighted bandwidth pressures.[1][3][5][7] Cybersecurity breaches and regulatory shifts, including **BEAD^[Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment]^ program turbulence, added urgency to resilient infrastructure builds.[2][3]

### AT&T
- AT&T's pending **$5.75 billion acquisition of Lumen’s mass markets fiber assets** advanced discussions, positioning it as a cornerstone for fiber expansion, with full closure eyed for 2026 alongside broader Lumen buyout talks.[1][3]
- Rapid deployment of **EchoStar’s 3.45 GHz mid-band spectrum** (from a $23 billion deal) gained early access, enhancing 5G capacity for data-heavy applications in key US markets.[3]
- Committed **$14 billion to energy-efficient network upgrades** to counter AI workload power demands, treating energy as a core planning factor amid rising costs and grid saturation.[1]
- Faced fallout from **Salt Typhoon cyberattack**, where hackers breached core systems, exposing wiretap platforms and **CDR^[Call Detail Records]^**—a widespread issue across peers.[2]
- Won a court order halting **T-Mobile’s Easy Switch tool** from porting AT&T customer data, protecting subscriber retention in competitive data services.[4]
- Q4 fiber growth hit **280,000 new subscribers** (up 3.3% YoY), marking 12 straight quarters over 200k, underscoring fiber as a long-term data strategy amid **FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access]^** rivalry.[3]
- Median downlink speeds dipped Q1-Q3 2025 due to **FWA capacity exhaustion**, reflecting nationwide data traffic surges.[5]

### T-Mobile
- Advanced **open-access fiber talks** with Tillman FiberCo as a potential anchor tenant, extending **FTTH^[Fiber to the Home]^** reach via partnerships amid trials in select markets.[1][3]
- Struck a **spectrum lease deal with Comcast** for 71 licenses in the **600 MHz low-band** (covering 149 million people), bolstering rural data coverage and 5G Home Internet.[3]
- Instituted a **soft data cap on fixed wireless** for its 5 million subscribers, prioritizing traffic to manage speeds amid heavy usage—exacerbating industry **FWA^[Fixed Wireless Access]^** strains.[3][5][7]
- **Salt Typhoon breach** compromised core networks, including wiretap systems and **CDR^[Call Detail Records]^**, prompting industry-wide alerts.[2]
- **FCC conditional approval** for **SpaceX “Supplemental Coverage from Space”** (SCS) nears commercialization, with 600+ Starlink satellites reusing mobile spectrum for direct-to-device data services.[1]
- National Advertising Division recommended clarifying **Price Lock claim** after AT&T challenge, amid aggressive marketing for data plans.[3]
- **FWA subscriber growth** (now ~5 million) drives over half of network traffic, per estimates, fueling capacity debates.[7]

### Verizon
- **Starry acquisition** (post-Frontier $20B deal) progresses toward 2026 close, enhancing urban fiber-data footprint alongside Tilman JV for broadband scale.[1]
- New CEO **Dan Schulman** (ex-PayPal) signals **major business overhauls** after Q3 stumbles in fixed wireless, including **brand refresh and myHome launch**—an AI-augmented home internet suite with integrated data services.[3][4]
- Rolled out **wireless price cuts**, sparking price war fears to recapture postpaid data customers amid aggressive competition.[4]
- Surpassed **1 GW in renewable PPAs^[Power Purchase Agreements]^** for network power resilience, addressing AI/data center grid pressures.[1]
- **Salt Typhoon hackers** infiltrated core systems, exposing wiretap platforms and **CDR^[Call Detail Records]^** like peers.[2]
- **FWA traffic** exceeds half of total network load (per MoffettNathanson), contributing to Q1-Q3 median downlink speed drops from capacity crunch.[5][7]

### Lumen
- **Consumer fiber operations** tagged for sale (per Reuters, December report)
