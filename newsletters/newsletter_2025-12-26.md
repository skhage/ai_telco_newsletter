### Key Industry Trends in Data Technology (Week of December 19-25, 2025)

The U.S. data technology sector closed 2025 with sustained momentum in **fiber network expansion** through mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures, alongside robust **fixed wireless access (FWA)** growth from major carriers, despite competitive pressures on cable broadband providers^[Fiber to the Home (FTTH)]. Consolidation remains a dominant theme, with multiple high-value deals poised for 2026 closure, including fiber asset transfers and spectrum purchases that bolster network capacity for AI-driven workloads and broadband competition[1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/)[4](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025-12-09:newsml_FIT79Hcp2:0-fitch-ratings-u-s-telecommunications-outlook-neutral-for-2026/). FWA services from Verizon and T-Mobile continued to erode traditional cable subscriber bases, with estimates indicating FWA now handles over half the traffic on their networks, intensifying rivalry in residential and enterprise data delivery[7](https://www.lightreading.com/fixed-wireless-access/2025-in-review-fwa-s-fangs-stay-sharp)[8](https://broadbandbreakfast.com/chart-of-fixed-wireless-access-subscribers/). Year-end reviews highlight power management as an emerging constraint for data-intensive networks, with operators prioritizing energy-efficient upgrades amid rising AI demands, while open-access fiber models and horizontal infrastructure separation gain traction to optimize investments[1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/). No major new announcements surfaced this specific week, but ongoing regulatory progress and Q4 projections underscore fiber passings growth and neutral credit outlooks for 2026[4](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025-12-09:newsml_FIT79Hcp2:0-fitch-ratings-u-s-telecommunications-outlook-neutral-for-2026/).

### AT&T
AT&T's data technology strategy emphasizes aggressive fiber acquisition and infrastructure partnerships to scale **FTTH**^[Fiber to the Home] passings and support convergence with wireless services. Its pending $5.75 billion acquisition of Lumen's consumer fiber business—covering nearly 1 million subscribers and 4 million passings—was highlighted in multiple 2025 year-end analyses as a cornerstone for 2026 network expansion, with closure expected early next year alongside a $23 billion spectrum deal from EchoStar[1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/)[2](https://www.fierce-network.com/broadband/fierce-networks-2025-telecom-and-tech-ma-tracker)[4](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025-12-09:newsml_FIT79Hcp2:0-fitch-ratings-u-s-telecommunications-outlook-neutral-for-2026/). The company committed $14 billion to energy-efficient network upgrades in 2025, addressing power constraints for data-heavy AI workloads, while expanding its open-access joint venture with BlackRock (Gigapower) to accelerate broadband deployment without full ownership risks[1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/). Analysts position AT&T to potentially surpass T-Mobile in valuation through this "simple formula" of fiber builds, M&A, and operational efficiencies, with Fitch affirming a neutral 2026 outlook tied to these investments[4](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025-12-09:newsml_FIT79Hcp2:0-fitch-ratings-u-s-telecommunications-outlook-neutral-for-2026/)[6](https://sundaybrief.com/atts-simple-formula/). No fresh weekly announcements, but these deals reinforce AT&T's leadership in U.S. fiber passings growth.

### T-Mobile
T-Mobile solidified its data technology edge via FWA dominance and fiber joint ventures, with 2025 reviews noting its trial of open-access fiber partnerships and closure of the $4.3 billion US Cellular deal in August, enhancing spectrum and footprint for 5G-based broadband[1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/)[3](https://techblog.comsoc.org/category/cable-broadband-access/). A key highlight is the recently closed JV with EQT to acquire **FTTH**^[Fiber to the Home] provider Lumos, targeting 12-15 million homes passed by 2030, approved after DEI policy updates; this complements partnerships like Metronet/Lumos for non-acquisitive expansion[1](https://www.cartesian.com/2025-year-end-review/)[2](https://www.fierce-network.com/
