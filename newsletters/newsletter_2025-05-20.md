## Company-Specific News & Announcements

### **AT&T**

AT&T continues aggressive investment in fiber infrastructure expansion across key markets. The company is focused on overbuilding its FTTH footprint to capture more residential and enterprise customers amid intensifying competition from both cable operators and other telcos[4](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations). AT&T’s strategy leverages its lower cost structure for fiber deployment compared to legacy providers while bundling wireless services for added value.

### **T-Mobile**

T-Mobile remains at the center of industry speculation regarding further expansion into pureplay fiber assets. While analysts have suggested potential targets like Hotwire Communications or leveraging Metronet/Lumos networks, T-Mobile’s leadership has indicated a preference for acquiring established fiber providers rather than building out greenfield projects[2](https://www.lightreading.com/fttx/t-mobile-ceo-prefers-pureplay-fiber-for-m-a)[4](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations). Additionally:

> “We have completed Day 178 of the 180-day clock for the FCC^[Federal Communications Commission] to approve T-Mobile’s acquisition of US Cellular... we expect good news for Magenta in May.”  
> — Sunday Brief

This signals imminent regulatory approval that could further boost T-Mobile’s spectrum holdings and rural reach.

### **Verizon**

Verizon reported a significant loss of postpaid phone subscribers last quarter (289,000), highlighting ongoing challenges in retaining high-value customers amid fierce competition from AT&T and T-Mobile[2](https://www.lightreading.com/fttx/t-mobile-ceo-prefers-pureplay-fiber-for-m-a). In response:

|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Competitive Moves  | Emphasizing bundled offerings but facing pressure from rivals’ superior customer satisfaction scores.[4](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations) |

### **Lumen Technologies**

Lumen remains active as a key vendor within broader market analyses but did not announce any major new initiatives this week specific to data technology. However, Lumen's existing metro fiber assets are frequently cited as attractive targets or partners for larger telcos seeking regional expansion opportunities[1](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/07/3076293/0/en/US-Telecom-Market-Analysis-2025-2029-with-AT-T-Verizon-and-T-Mobile-Leading.html)[4](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations).

### **Charter Communications**

The biggest headline: Charter has agreed to acquire Cox Communications in a $34.5 billion deal—creating what will be America’s largest cable operator with nearly 70 million locations passed and over 37 million customers served[2](https://www.lightreading.com/fttx/t-mobile-ceo-prefers-pureplay-fiber-for-m-a)[3](https://www.channelfutures.com/mergers-acquisitions/charter-cox-acquisition-5-questions-from-channel).

Key implications:
* Massive scale-up positions Charter as an even stronger competitor against both traditional telcos (like AT&T) and
