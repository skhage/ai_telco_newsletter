**Major Fiber Expansion via Lumos Acquisition**
  
T-Mobile made headlines by closing its joint venture with EQT to acquire Lumos—a regional FTTH provider operating a 7,500-mile network serving approximately 475,000 homes across the Mid-Atlantic region. This move brings many Lumos customers under the T-Mobile Fiber brand and marks a significant milestone for T-Mobile’s ambitions beyond wireless into fixed broadband [5](https://techblog.comsoc.org/category/t-mobile-us/) :

> "The joint venture combines the Un-carrier’s unique assets with EQT’s fiber infrastructure expertise...with the goal of reaching 3.5 million homes by end of 2028."

Key details:
  
* $950 million initial investment from T-Mobile; an additional $500 million planned between 2027–28.
* Full ownership of customer experience will transition to T-Mobile.
* Updated financial guidance expected during Q1 earnings call.

**Acquisition Strategy Commentary**

Despite persistent rumors about potential cable company acquisitions (notably Charter), CEO Mike Sievert reiterated that T-Mobile prefers “pure-play fiber” targets but did not rule out broader moves within fast-growing sectors like fiber broadband [2](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/charter-beats-t-mobile-in-wireless-growth).

### **Verizon**

No specific new product or partnership announcements emerged this week regarding Verizon's data technology initiatives. However, sector reports indicate that Verizon remains one of three dominant forces shaping overall market trends through continued investment in next-generation networks—especially as competition intensifies around converged services (wireless + wired) [1](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/07/3076293/0/en/U...

### **Lumen Technologies**

There were no notable news items directly related to Lumen this week regarding new deployments or partnerships within data technology sectors. However, analysts continue watching Lumen as an attractive acquisition target for larger players seeking rapid scale-out of FTTH^[Fiber to the Home]^ networks—particularly given recent M&A activity involving competitors like Lumos/T‑Mobile JV [2](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-techno...

### **Charter Communications**

**Wireless Growth Leadership**
  
Charter led all U.S. providers—including traditional mobile carriers—in net wireless line additions last quarter: 

* Added over 514,000 lines—outpacing even industry stalwart T‑Mobile.
* Demonstrates success leveraging hybrid-fiber/coaxial (HFC^[Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial]^)-based infrastructure for mobile service delivery.

This performance comes amid speculation about possible consolidation between cable operators and mobile carriers; however,
analysts note that HFC-based networks are functionally equivalent for delivering capacity needed by modern MVNOs^[Mobile Virtual Network Operators]^. Charter's rapid gains underscore how cable companies are reshaping competitive dynamics in both home internet and mobility markets[2](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-techno...
