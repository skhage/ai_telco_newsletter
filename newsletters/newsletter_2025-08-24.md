### AT&T

- **Lumen Fiber Acquisition:** AT&T is set to significantly expand its fiber presence with the acquisition of Lumen’s mass markets fiber business. This move cements AT&T’s leadership in business fiber, as it tops the U.S. leaderboard for lit fiber buildings for the ninth consecutive year[2](https://www.channelfutures.com/fiber/att-verizon-spectrum-top-us-business-fiber-farket).
- **Market Impact:** The Lumen deal is part of a broader consolidation trend, with AT&T aiming to further distance itself from competitors in both enterprise and residential fiber markets[2](https://www.channelfutures.com/fiber/att-verizon-spectrum-top-us-business-fiber-farket).

### T-Mobile

- **US Internet Acquisition:** T-Mobile is acquiring US Internet, a Minnesota-based fiber operator with fewer than 200,000 passings. This follows recent deals for Lumos and Metronet, signaling T-Mobile’s commitment to building a national fiber footprint[5](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/t-mobile-s-latest-fiber-buy-is-a-drop-in-the-bucket)[1](https://ts2.tech/en/top-10-us-internet-service-providers-of-2025-speed-coverage-and-customer-satisfaction-ranked/).
- **Fiber + FWA Strategy:** T-Mobile’s fiber expansion is explicitly positioned as complementary to its 5G FWA, not a replacement. The company plans to bring fiber close to homes and use FWA for the “last 100 feet” where fiber is cost-prohibitive[1](https://ts2.tech/en/top-10-us-internet-service-providers-of-2025-speed-coverage-and-customer-satisfaction-ranked/).
- **Reduced Backhaul Reliance:** By owning regional fiber networks, T-Mobile aims to reduce its dependence on leasing backhaul, strengthening its 5G network capacity and economics[1](https://ts2.tech/en/top-10-us-internet-service-providers-of-2025-speed-coverage-and-customer-satisfaction-ranked/).
