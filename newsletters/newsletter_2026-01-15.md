### Key Industry Trends in US Data Technology (Week of January 12-15, 2026)

The US telecommunications sector continues to prioritize **fiber acquisitions** and **converged broadband-mobile strategies** to enhance scale and reduce churn, with major carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon actively pursuing fiber assets amid ongoing 2025 M&A momentum spilling into 2026. Fixed wireless access (FWA) remains a strong performer in customer satisfaction, outpacing traditional fiber in value-for-price metrics, while cable operators such as Charter are aggressively deploying **CBRS spectrum**^[Citizens Broadband Radio Service] for strand-mounted small cells to build independent mobile infrastructure and challenge Verizon's dominance.[1](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/)[2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/looking-ahead-m-a-watch-for-2026)[4](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/5g-at-the-five-year-mark-weak-on-vision-strong-on-execution)[5](https://www.lightreading.com/network-platforms/how-charter-and-comcast-are-building-their-way-out-of-verizon-dependency)

Private equity-driven deals dominate broadband expansion, focusing on high-speed fiber builds, but strategic moves by incumbents highlight bundling priorities—customers combining mobile and home broadband generate higher revenue and lower churn rates. Cable's mobile market share hit 39% of US smartphone net adds in Q3 2025, with analysts forecasting **dramatic growth** in 2026 as operators like Charter leverage spectrum investments.[1](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/)[5](https://www.lightreading.com/network-platforms/how-charter-and-comcast-are-building-their-way-out-of-verizon-dependency)[6](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/cable-s-mobile-gains-could-grow-dramatically-in-2026)

### AT&T
AT&T's **$5.5 billion bid** for Lumen's retail **fiber business** (consumer fiber-to-the-home operations) advanced this week, underscoring the carrier's push toward nationwide broadband-mobile bundles to boost revenue and retention—fiber acquisitions bring AT&T closer to ubiquitous home broadband coverage, complementing its mobile footprint.[1](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/)[3](https://potsandpansbyccg.com/tag/t-mobile/)

However, the deal remains "far from over," with no formal confirmation from AT&T, reflecting ongoing negotiations amid 2026's expected wave of fiber-focused M&A to support convergence strategies. Customer satisfaction for **AT&T Fiber** lags behind FWA peers at +7 cNPS^[customer Net Promoter Score] on value-for-price, trailing T-Mobile FWA's +31.[2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/looking-ahead-m-a-watch-for-2026)[4](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/5g-at-the-five-year-mark-weak-on-vision-strong-on-execution)

### T-Mobile
T-Mobile's strategic joint ventures from 2025—partnering with EQT for Lumos and KKR for Metronet (which quickly acquired US Internet)—continue to fuel expectations for more **fiber M&A** in 2026, aligning with its spectrum expansion via the UScellular wireless purchase to support broadband bundling.[1](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/)

**T-Mobile FWA** leads in customer value perception at +31 cNPS, significantly ahead of fiber rivals, reinforcing its execution strength in 5G deployment five years post-launch. Analysts anticipate T-Mobile will seek additional fiber to enhance convergence plays.[2](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/looking-ahead-m-a-watch-for-2026)[4](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/5g-at-the-five-year-mark-weak-on-vision-strong-on-execution)

### Verizon
Verizon's acquisition of **fixed wireless access (FWA)** provider Starry highlights the growing importance of FWA, leveraging its mobile infrastructure for broadband expansion—**Verizon FWA** scores +24 cNPS on value-for-price, outperforming its own Fios fiber at -4.[1](https://www.telecompetitor.com/broadband-ma-2025-dominated-by-private-equity-buys-big-guys-made-strategic-deals/)[
