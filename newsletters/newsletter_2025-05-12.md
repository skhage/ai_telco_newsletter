## Key Industry Trends in US Data Technology (Week of May 12, 2025)

- **Aggressive Fiber Expansion:** Major telecoms are intensifying their focus on fiber deployments, with T-Mobile and AT&T both signaling increased investment and acquisition activity in the FTTH^[Fiber to the Home] space[2](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/charter-beats-t-mobile-in-wireless-growth)[4](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations/).
- **Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) Growth & Capacity Concerns:** FWA subscriber growth continues at a rapid pace, especially for T-Mobile and Verizon. However, analysts warn that spectrum utilization is rising quickly—potentially leading to congestion before the decade’s end[3](https://www.lightreading.com/fixed-wireless-access/when-will-fwa-run-out-of-steam).
- **Wireless Subscriber Shifts:** Charter Communications outpaced all rivals in wireless line additions last quarter, highlighting cable’s growing role as a mobile competitor[2](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/charter-beats-t-mobile-in-wireless-growth).
- **M&A Speculation Remains High:** Rumors persist about potential acquisitions among telcos and cable operators—especially involving fiber assets—but executives remain noncommittal publicly[2](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/charter-beats-t-mobile-in-wireless-growth)[4](https://sundaybrief.com/q1-telco-top-five-earnings-five-observations/).

## Company-Specific News

### **AT&T**

- AT&T maintains a strong position in spectrum capacity due to its relatively conservative approach toward FWA compared to rivals. Analysts suggest AT&T has ample headroom to become more aggressive in acquiring FWA subscribers if it chooses[3](https://www.lightreading.com/fixed-wireless-access/when-will-fwa-run-out-of-steam).

### **T-Mobile**

- T-Mobile is rapidly increasing its utilization of available spectrum assets as it adds FWA subscribers at an industry-leading pace. If current trends continue, T-Mobile's network could reach Verizon-level utilization rates within four years—a sign of both success and looming capacity challenges if not addressed through further densification or new spectrum acquisition[3](https://www.lightreading.com/fixed-wireless-access/when-will-fwa-run-out-of-steam).

> "T-Mobile's utilization of its spectrum assets is rising fast... Given the trajectory of FWA subscriber growth... T-Mobile is likely to match Verizon's spectrum utilization rate in the next four years." — Bernstein analysts

- The company recently closed a joint venture with EQT to acquire Lumos—a regional FTTH provider—bringing many Lumos customers under the new "T-Mobile Fiber" brand. This move signals an ongoing commitment by T-Mobile to expand beyond wireless into fixed broadband markets via fiber infrastructure[5](https://techblog.comsoc.org/category/t-mobile-us/)^[FTTH].
  
  - CEO Mike Sievert reiterated that while pure-play fiber remains their preference for expansion, they are open-minded about future M&A opportunities but downplayed immediate interest in acquiring major cable companies like Charter Communications directly[2](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/charter-beats-t-mobile-in-wireless-growth).

### **Verizon**

- Verizon continues heavy investment into both postpaid wireless growth and FWA services. It currently leads major MNOs^[Mobile Network Operators] in terms of overall spectrum portfolio utilization—a metric expected only to rise as demand for data grows across consumer segments.
  
  - Analysts caution that this high level of network use could bring forward congestion issues unless mitigated by additional investments or strategic changes before decade’s end[3](https://www.lightreading.com/fixed-wireless-access/when-will-fwa-run-out-of-steam).

### **Lumen Technologies**

*No significant new announcements specific to Lumen were reported this week regarding US data technology.* However, Lumen remains relevant due to speculation around possible asset sales or partnerships as larger players seek additional fiber infrastructure for expansion strategies.

### **Charter Communications**

- Charter led all US providers last quarter with 514,000 net wireless line additions—outpacing even mobile-first incumbents like T-Mobile—which underscores how aggressively cable operators are leveraging converged offerings (broadband + mobile) for market share gains.
  
  - Despite persistent rumors about being an acquisition target (notably by T-Mobile), Charter leadership has not confirmed any such discussions; meanwhile, industry analysts note that most large cable networks—including those operated by Charter—are now predominantly fiber-based or hybrid systems capable of supporting advanced services like mobile backhaul and multi-gigabit broadband delivery.[2](https://www.lightreading.com/
