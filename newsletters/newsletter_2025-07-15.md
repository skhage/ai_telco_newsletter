### AT&T

- **Awaiting Regulatory Approval for Lumen Fiber Assets**
  - AT&T is poised to acquire Lumen’s mass market fiber access assets for $5.75 billion^[Lumen Technologies Inc]. This deal will significantly expand AT&T’s FTTH^[Fiber to the Home] footprint as it seeks to bolster its position in fixed broadband markets[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-gets-its-m-a-wishes-after-ditching-dei-53423/)[2](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250714/analyst-angle/sunday-brief-influencing).
  - The acquisition is part of a broader industry trend toward converged offerings that bundle mobile and home broadband services[3](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/downgrades/25/07/46323942/t-mobiles-growth-stunted-by-fiber-shortage-and-market-rivalry).

### T-Mobile

- **Regulatory Green Light for UScellular Acquisition**
  - The Department of Justice has cleared T-Mobile’s $4.4 billion acquisition of most UScellular assets (announced May 2024), which includes spectrum holdings but not towers[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-gets-its-m-a-wishes-after-ditching-dei-53423/)[2](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250714/analyst-angle/sunday-brief-influencing).
    > “This transaction looks more like a MetroPCS acquisition than Sprint: some spectrum, lots of retail operations... It adds to T-Mobile’s 600 MHz and 2.5 GHz holdings without breaking spectrum caps.”[2](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250714/analyst-angle/sunday-brief-influencing)
    - Expected improvements: Enhanced coverage in secondary markets such as Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, New Hampshire, and Maine.
    - Integration with Lumos and Metronet fiber assets will support product convergence.
  
- **Metronet & Lumos Integration**
  - FCC approval was also granted for T-Mobile's investments in Metronet (fiber) and Lumos; these moves are expected to improve performance where T-Mobile previously lacked robust fixed infrastructure[2](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250714/analyst-angle/sunday-brief-influencing).

#### Market Challenges
   - Despite these expansions, analysts note that T-Mobile faces a *fiber shortage* relative to rivals following recent deals by AT&T (with Lumen), Verizon (with Frontier), Charter/Cox merger—potentially weakening its competitive position unless it can offer compelling bundled products[3](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/downgrades/25/07/46323942/t-mobiles-growth-stunted-by-fiber-shortage-and-market-rivalry).

### Verizon

- **Frontier Communications Acquisition Approved**
   - Verizon received regulatory clearance for its $20 billion purchase of Frontier Communications’ broadband business—a move aimed at strengthening its fixed network reach alongside wireless dominance[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-gets-its-m-a-wishes-after-ditching-dei-53423/) .
   - This aligns with an industry-wide push toward integrated service bundles combining wireless mobility with high-speed home internet.

### Lumen Technologies

   - As noted above under AT&T: Lumen is divesting significant fiber access infrastructure through the pending sale to AT&T ($5.75B). This marks another step back from consumer-facing operations as Lumen refocuses on enterprise solutions or other strategic priorities[1](https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/t-mobile-us-gets-it...

### Charter Communications

#### Merger With Cox Communications
   - Charter has agreed to merge with Cox Communications in a $34.5 billion deal that will create one of the largest cable-broadband entities in North America:
     * Nearly *70 million* U.S households passed
     * ~36 million total customers post-merger
     * Over *10 million* mobile lines—a segment now seen as central growth engine due to cable MVNOs
