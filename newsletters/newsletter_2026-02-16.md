### Key Industry Trends in US Data Technology (Week of Feb 9-13, 2026)

The US telecommunications sector is witnessing an intense **fiber frenzy** and **M&A boom**, with major carriers aggressively expanding fiber-to-the-home (FTTH)^[Fiber to the Home] networks amid a projected market growth of 12.4% CAGR from 2025-2030, driven by demand for high-speed broadband.[1](https://finviz.com/news/278809/vz-wins-regulatory-nod-for-frontier-buyout-will-it-boost-prospects) Simultaneously, **robocall mitigation** via STIR/SHAKEN^[Secure Telephone Identity Revisited / Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs] protocols shows stark disparities, with Tier-1 carriers achieving 85% signed traffic (93% A-level attestation) in 2025, while smaller carriers lag at 17.5%, undermining overall gains and exposing vulnerabilities in legacy TDM^[Time Division Multiplexing] to IP migrations.[2](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260204380440/en/TNS-2026-Robocall-Report-Signed-Call-Traffic-Gap-Between-Tier-1-and-Smaller-Carriers-Undermining-Robocall-Mitigation-Gains) [4](https://broadbandbreakfast.com/john-haraburda-what-telco-must-do-next-on-stir-shaken/) AI-driven network analytics and voice trust restoration are emerging priorities, alongside wireless market convergence where cable operators like Charter snagged 45% of new wireless subscribers in 2025, pressuring traditional carriers' margins.[6](https://www.lightreading.com/wireless/the-great-convergence-the-state-of-u-s-wireless-competition)

### Verizon (VZ)
Verizon secured all regulatory approvals for its $20 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications, a pivotal move to supercharge its fiber expansion to over 30 million passings across 31 states, incorporating Frontier's 3.3 million broadband customers and 8.8 million fiber locations as of Q3 2025.[1](https://finviz.com/news/278809/vz-wins-regulatory-nod-for-frontier-buyout-will-it-boost-prospects) This deal unlocks cross-selling synergies, bundling Verizon's mobility, home internet, streaming, and connected home services with Frontier's premium broadband to reduce churn in a saturated market. Verizon also acquired spectrum assets from UScellular as part of the latter's pivot to a tower company.[3](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/2025-telco-talking-points-ai-fiber-frenzy-and-an-ma-boom/) On robocall fronts, Verizon led Tier-1 peers with strong STIR/SHAKEN adoption, contributing to 85% signed traffic industry-wide.[2](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260204380440/en/TNS-2026-Robocall-Report-Signed-Call-Traffic-Gap-Between-Tier-1-and-Smaller-Carriers-Undermining-Robocall-Mitigation-Gains)

### T-Mobile
T-Mobile completed the acquisition of UScellular's wireless assets, bolstering its spectrum holdings and market position amid wireless competition convergence, where the top three carriers face razor-thin margins.[3](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/2025-telco-talking-points-ai-fiber-frenzy-and-an-ma-boom/) [6](https://www.lightreading.com/wireless/the-great-convergence-the-state-of-u-s-wireless-competition) T-Mobile also participated in spectrum deals with Verizon and AT&T from the UScellular transaction. In robocall mitigation, it maintained high STIR/SHAKEN compliance among Tier-1 carriers, with 85% of inter-Tier-1 traffic signed at 93% A-level in 2025, though challenges like TDM bypasses (40% unsigned) persist.[2](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260204380440/en/TNS-2026-Robocall-Report-Signed-Call-Traffic-Gap-Between-Tier-1-and-Smaller-Carriers-Undermining-Robocall-Mitigation-Gains) [4](https://broadbandbreakfast.com/john-haraburda-what-telco-must-do-next-on-stir-shaken/)
