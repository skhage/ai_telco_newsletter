### Week in Review: Data Technology Trends in the U.S. Telecom Industry

#### **FTTH Deployments and M&A Activity**
- **Accelerating FTTH Deployments**: The outlook for Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) deployments in 2025 is promising, with companies like Lumos Fiber and MetroNet set to receive fresh capital from T-Mobile and its partners to accelerate their expansion plans. Verizon is expected to increase its FTTH passings by about 650,000, while AT&T will modestly expand its FTTH passings to around 2.7 million. T-Mobile plans to enter into joint venture partnerships with private equity sponsors to acquire Lumos and MetroNet, aiming to expand its FTTH footprint to cover 12 to 15 million passings in the long term[1].

#### **Capex and FOCF Projections**
- **Capex Trends**: U.S. telecom capex is expected to increase modestly by around 3% in 2025 after two consecutive years of declines. Verizon's capex will increase by about $1 billion, primarily due to FTTH builds. T-Mobile's capex will see a small increase, assuming it closes on its acquisition of US Cellular in the second half of 2025. AT&T's capex remains relatively flat, while Lumen's capex will increase around $200 million for new PCF deals[1].

- **FOCF Projections**: Free Operating Cash Flow (FOCF) is expected to show mixed trends. Verizon's FOCF is projected to decline modestly to around $18 billion. AT&T's FOCF is expected to decline to around $16 billion, primarily due to the loss of distributions from DirecTV, although this is partially offset by payments from TPG. T-Mobile's FOCF is expected to increase to around $17.5 billion in 2025[1].

#### **Wireless Carrier Performance**
- **OpenSignal Report**: The latest report from OpenSignal highlights significant differences in wireless carrier performance. T-Mobile dominated Verizon and AT&T in several key metrics, including 5G availability and download speed experience. T-Mobile users experienced 5G roughly 72% of the time, while AT&T customers saw it around 15% and Verizon subscribers around 10%[2].

#### **Cybersecurity Concerns**
- **Salt Typhoon Breaches**: Several U.S. telecom companies have been breached by Chinese state-backed hackers tracked as Salt Typhoon. AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies previously confirmed breaches, and now Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications, and Windstream have also been added to the list. T-Mobile's network was also compromised but not linked to Salt Typhoon by its Chief Security Officer[3][5].

#### **5G SA Deployments**
- **AT&T and Verizon 5G SA Rollout**: AT&T and Verizon are set to roll out 5G Standalone (SA) networks in 2025, marking a significant step towards standalone 5G deployments. This move will enable advanced features like network slicing. Although both carriers have previously claimed to have launched 5G SA networks, these deployments were not nationwide rollouts. Verizon has launched 5G SA in three U.S. states, while AT&T's rollout is expected to cover broader geographic areas[4].

### Summary

This week's news highlights several key trends in the U.S. telecom industry:

- **FTTH Expansion**: Companies like Lumos Fiber and MetroNet are set to receive significant investments to accelerate their FTTH deployments.
- **Capex and FOCF**: U.S. telecom capex is expected to increase modestly, with Verizon and T-Mobile seeing slight increases. FOCF projections show mixed trends, with Verizon and T-Mobile experiencing slight declines or increases.
- **Wireless Carrier Performance**: T-Mobile significantly outperformed Verizon and AT&T in key metrics like 5G availability and download speed experience.
- **Cybersecurity Concerns**: Several major U.S. telecom companies have been breached by Chinese state-backed hackers, highlighting ongoing cybersecurity risks.
- **5G SA Deployments**: AT&T and Verizon are set to roll out 5G SA networks in 2025, marking a significant step towards standalone 5G deployments.

These developments underscore the evolving landscape of data technology in the U.S. telecom industry, with a focus on FTTH expansion, wireless carrier performance, cybersecurity threats, and advancements in 5G technology.
